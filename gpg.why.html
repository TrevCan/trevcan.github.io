	<h1>Why is GnuPG acting up ? </h1>

<p>
After trying several things to fix encryption and decryption in GnuPG I have no 
real hopes. I honestly don't know what to do but to keep asking. I've searched on 
stackoverflow for pinentry and gpg-agent acting up and taking too much time and 
I only found one stack overflow question [\[0\]](#references) which didn't get
that close to my issue.
It slows down when using the pinentry-curses, pinentry-gtk-2 binaries.

<h1> the problem</h1>
<p>
I've been using the [https://passwordstore.org] program for quite a while now,
about 8 months I'd say. All was going well until about 3 weeks ago. I don't 
know what happened, what caused it or why. Pass started acting up, it took from
20 to 30 seconds what used to take literally 1 second. The pinentry-gtk-2 
program was taking a whole lot of time to start. So I dug deeper. Eventually I
found out that it definitely had something to do with GnuPG as decrypting
files directly through GnuPG also yielded the same results, after all, pass is
just a bash script that uses gpg encryption and decryption commands. So then I
went searching on the internets and it was pretty bad. I couldn't really find
any information regarding GnuPG acting up except for [\[0\]](#references),

First of all, your help, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hello. I've tried almost* everything to get gpg up and running but it just, 
won't work! So, storytime. Almost after I went full linux I stumbled upon 
<a href="http://passwordstore.org">pass</a>, a great tool to manage passwords in a 
convenient way. I've been using it for around 8-9 months. And it's worked like 
a charm, until about 3 weeks ago. I don't know if this was a system upgrade or 
something but point is, it just slowed way down. When requesting a password, 
it'd take anywhere from 20 to 40 seconds to just show the pinentry binary (the 
one that asks you for the password), in particular, the <code>pinentry-gtk-2</code>, but 
guess what? I tried using the ncurses version also and it didn't work! I tried 
decrypting and encrypting files directly by using gpg, but yielded the same 
results!, cause after all, <code>pass</code> is just a bash script that uses gpg commands 
for encryption and decryption. So, yeah. After that, I tried searching on the 
internets, but didn't stumble upon anything at all except for 
[this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/628092/why-would-gpg-pinentry-be
-slow-when-opening-in-gui-but-instantaneous-when-openin) which didn't seem to 
solve the problem, as my problem happened with all <code>pinentry*</code> binaries (yes, 
even <code>pinentry-tty</code> !!). I tried the solution but it didn't work. Later on, 
actually yesterday, I hopped onto libera IRC to join the <code>gnupg</code> channel, as 
suggested by members in the <code>pass</code> channel, as this is clearly much more 
specific to gpg. In the <code>gnupg</code> channel I had the fortune to be able to talk to 
someone to walk me through a ton of things. Testing, after testing and testing. 
We even tried creating less-resource intensive keys, creating temporary gnu 
directories to store keys in, et cetera. I'm documenting most (if not all, ) 
this info at <a href="https://trevcan.github.io/gpg.why">this website</a> .
</p>
<p>
**Also, I should point out that the behaviour is not intermittent, _it is 
definitely constant_. I do have a password cache enabled, but every time time 
has passed or I manually clear the password cache (with `echo RELOADAGENT | 
gpg-connect-agent<code> and then </code>gpgconf --kill all`) the same behaviour happens.**

I haven't tried this yet, but maybe later in the day I'll try booting off a 
linux arch iso and trying to install gpg and checking if it's my laptop or 
something...

*maybe i will reinstall arch linux

<li>try with other kernels:</li>
	- linux-lts, linux

<h1> done</h1>

<ul>
<li>yes i've tried with normal lunux kernel and linux-lts and linux-zen. . same behaviour for both.</li>
<li>live boot off iso: yes, there os a change, just does it instantly lol, which rules out hardware !! yayyyy.</li>
