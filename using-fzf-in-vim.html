<p>hey there! I don&rsquo;t know why this came to me but I guess I&rsquo;ve seen
several internet videos in which linuxy users are using a nice, fancy
prompt to search files. Turns out they&rsquo;re using
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/">fzf!</a>
, a nice tool to easily search for files in the command line. To some
degree I guess it is like a dmenu prompt but in a command line. So yeah,
by default it acts like a find any file recursively in the current directory,
yes, including hidden files; yet still acts like a standard unix command
that can take input from stdin (standard input) and only show those choices
and of course, prints to stdout the result.</p>

<p>So one can do something like</p>

<p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF | fzf
one
two
three
four
john cena
EOF

</code></pre>
and that will basically show you an interactive command line prompt which can
let you make a choice. This is kind of similar to pedantic software&rsquo;s choice
tool by
Sylvain Gauthier and Francois-Xavier Carton.
<a href="https://pedantic.software/syg/blog/minimalism_2_choice.html">Here&rsquo;s</a> a blog
post from Sylvain in which he explains what his tool does and its uses. I
guess it kinda differs to some degree but yeah.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the fuzzy finder. So after seeing how not so useful this was,
at least to me, I decided to make a quick internet search to see if I could
use this in vim. And I could! As I&rsquo;ve already said at the start of this post,
I&rsquo;ve seen several internet humans use vim as a file-finder. So I cloned a
sample vim plugin which connects the fzf vim plugin which only gives core
functions but doesn&rsquo;t actually implement anything. So installing all these
stuff gives me a pretty prompt like this:
<img src="https://trevcan.duckdns.org/files/fzf-in-vim.png" alt="fzf in vim" /></p>

<p>and yeah that&rsquo;s cool, isn&rsquo;t it?
If you&rsquo;re interested in how to set it up I&rsquo;ll put the steps below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>install fzf, can be found in the official Arch Linux repos and pretty much
any other distro</p></li>
<li><p>install fzf core functions vim plugin; simply clone the official fzf repo
to <code>~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/fzfcore</code> to start the plugin on vim startup.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><pre><code>git clone "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git" ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/fzfcore
</code></pre>
note: this will only work if you have the vim pack functionality. It probably
is if you keep vim up to date. I think this was released in vim 8.0</p>

<ol>
<li>install <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf.vim</a> as another vim
plugin. Same as step 2.</li>
</ol>


<p><pre><code>git clone "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim" ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/fzf.vim
</code></pre>
And that should do the trick. Now just readthedocs @
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim#commands">the fzf.vim docs readme</a>
and tldr;: use <code>:Files</code> to search within your home dir, hit enter and the file
will be opened in vim. Also, it will show you a small preview (with syntax
highlighting, if <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> is installed.)</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s it for this blog post. should probably sleep.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite simple. No, I didn&rsquo;t create any of
these config files but I guess sharing is caring, right?</p>
