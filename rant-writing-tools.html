<p>whoami ? well, honestly, no one to have the authority to say anything relevant
regarding this issue. I am merely a teenager so please you have all the right
to ignore this stuff; also, i don&rsquo;t know why i just wrote this paragraph.</p>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s get to it. Thanks to my respect to myself of privacy and the right
to actually have an annoying private life and talk to people, browse the
internets without actually being spied on and be farmed on as a farm animal
for personal data I have several ads coming up very often. Repeating
themselves. A lot. Literally, <strong>a lot lot lotlotststs</strong>.</p>

<p>The ad that&rsquo;s annoying me the most is Le <em>Grammarly</em>. You&rsquo;ve probably heard of
it if you&rsquo;re a student, unfortunately. I don&rsquo;t have any actual grudge against
spell checkers or whatever but I think taking the things to a much farther
level is bad. You shouldn&rsquo;t be inferring or passive-aggressively suggesting
grammar styles to students. They should write like they want, of course
when turning in an assignment check your spelling and coherence of ideas or
whatever; but that&rsquo;s it! Literally it! I shouldn&rsquo;t have a little shit software
tell me that I&rsquo;ve plagiarized something! If I have, I will definitely know
myself. Okay, maybe if you forget but that&rsquo;s it. Also, I think that these
kinds of companies that most likely use a shit-load of data-sets to infer
what <em>should be written</em> are wrong. Just like several machine learning algos
have proven to have very biased datasets, this could prove a new era of having
biased opinions, essays, and ideas in general. We do not have to put
everything thru a pseudo-fancy software that tells you which ideas are right
and wrong and/or (in) coherently written. That&rsquo;s literally the job of your
teacher. If you&rsquo;re leaving it up to <em>gruh-meourlee</em> to tell you what to write
you shouldn&rsquo;t consider writing at all. It&rsquo;s your writing! It&rsquo;s yur ideas!
Decide for yourself. <em><strong>fuck up for yourself</strong></em> and <em>don&rsquo;t</em>.</p>

<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do one on the cheesy-like software if you
know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;ll maybe rant about plagiarism and capitalised
knowledge when studying. Not sure if I said that write. English is (not?) my
first language. I was born in the U.S. but only lived there for 4 years ffs,
so I guess I&rsquo;ve absorbed a style of my own and I should note, most of the
internet/media content I view / watch / listen to is in English, so yeah,
there&rsquo;s that. Whatever.</p>
