<h1>i feel useless</h1>

<p>yes, indeed I do.
Even though I can provide ideas, experiencie and opinions within
my area of expertise,
I do not fill fulfilled.</p>

<p>I feel <strong>not useful</strong>. I am
trying to teach someone something
but they really don&rsquo;t get it!
They barely get it at all!
You are a good person, kinda trying
to understand but you&rsquo;re not at all putting in the effort.
I explain, you look at me in deception and
I try to explain but you barely make
any questions.</p>

<p>I had already teached you some
of this which means that you
are either a) very distracted and
not interested in learning about
this topic; b) you don&rsquo;t like me,
you&rsquo;re thinking of something bad
or arrogant I made; or c) your
incentives to learn are
non-existant.</p>

<p>That is bad. Any of these problems
is bad. Some worse than others.
Communication <strong>is key</strong>. Yet
you don&rsquo;t say shit.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t seem to want to learn.
I think I&rsquo;m trying my best in
order to teach but neither
am I inspired at all. I don&rsquo;t
like working for tyrants.</p>

<hr />

<p>And you know, after being absent
on a team and being occupied at
other things - for several hours -
I can tell you that my opinions are
not valuable to the team. I try
to give ideas, let others be yet
the design we were working on
went to fucking trash and we started
doing everything from the start.</p>

<p>And I truly try to help but none
of the actions I critique are valuated. I can say good job or whateved but at this point I&rsquo;m
practically nonexistent.</p>
