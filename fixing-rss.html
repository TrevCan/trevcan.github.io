<p>It&rsquo;s hard. Well, maybe not that hard. But when
you coded a half-assed program to generate an RSS
feed using shell scripting inside a makefile it&rsquo;s gonna
be pretty hard to fix it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most likely going to rewrite all the RSS feed generator
in C. I hope that doesn&rsquo;t bring any more problems&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, it all began when one of my readers told me that he
was attempting to use the RSS feed and told me that it was
broken. He didn&rsquo;t explain much else beyond that, aside from
the fact that the atom link was broken too.</p>

<p>And by broken, he meant that it wasn&rsquo;t being properly parsed. But
the atom link just has been broken for a while - because the file
doesn&rsquo;t exist on purpose. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to fix both, the RSS
and the Atom feeds which are very similar but just haven&rsquo;t had
the will to do it, until now apparently. I hope this will lasts
long enough that I am able to fix both problems.</p>

<p>Well, onto the story. So I replied back to him, thinking if I should
even reply. Should I reply right now saying the problem has been
acknowledged and I&rsquo;ll try to fix it or email him when it&rsquo;s fixed !?
I don&rsquo;t know. Well, I replied anyway, saying that the RSS generator
was probably doing something wrong and that caused the parsing in his
RSS feed to not work. I mean, just opening the file in chromium-
a web browser-
yielded a parsing error.</p>

<p>Turns out, the error was in the title of one of my blog posts. It
had two <code>&lt;/em&gt;</code> tags, literally. Notice that <code>&lt;/em&gt;</code> is the closing
tag of <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> but turns out I forgot to write the opening <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
tag in the title. I wanted a part my title to show up in italics
so that&rsquo;s what I thought I wrote in, one <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and then one <code>&lt;/em&gt;</code>
tag. But I wrote just two <code>&lt;/em&gt;</code> instead. So the only
thing I had to do was remove one single slash character <code>/</code>, add
the file to staging through git with <code>git add file</code>, commit and
push to my server. Then wait for the blog to be generated. Because
it&rsquo;s not HTML. It&rsquo;s markdown and it has to be parsed first into html.
Then the RSS feed is generated and so on.</p>

<p>I waited for it to finish, it took a minute and a half or so. Now I
checked again and there it was, without no error in chromium. Showing
the ugly XML file. Then I put in the RSS url into a free RSS viewer
<a href="#references">[0]</a> and it worked! It really worked.</p>

<p>I was very proud of that. To be fair, I only found out about that wrong
<code>&lt;/em</code> because the chromium browser said error parsing at line something
column something. Still, that was fast debugging.</p>

<a name="step-1-of-making-a-better-RSS-feed"></a>
<h1>step 1 of making a better RSS feed</h1>

<p>probably, code in something that removes all html special characters
such as html tags and replaces them with nothing. Or maybe its markdown
equivalent. e.g. replace <code>&lt;em&gt; bla bla &lt;/em&gt;</code> with <code>_ bla bla _</code> and
so on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s easy enough I guess, I&rsquo;ll do it later today maybe. I&rsquo;m still unsure
of what I&rsquo;m going to code or how I should fix the whole RSS feed generator
thing. I&rsquo;m unsure if it should all go into one program. or if I should
outsource some tasks to the makefile that in turn, uses the <code>git</code> command
to get important things such as the date, file name, link, etc. Maybe
I should follow the UNIX way.
<strong>Your program should do the following: Do one thing and do it well</strong>
Maybe I should have several tiny programs that help me and then pipe them
together. I think that sounds nice.</p>

<p>Please share your thoughts!</p>
