<p>written on march 29th</p>

<p>I am addicted to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a></p>

<p>Or maybe I am just too much of an asshole to want to talk to my friends.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything to say. I&rsquo;ve recoursed back into using my phone
more often, and <em>not</em> leaving it behing. I used to leave it behind
when going to the bathroom, for a walk or just for anything, actually.</p>

<p>Yet today I was very worried. I really liked someone, I told her that
I liked her but she was in shock. I didn&rsquo;t see her again until like
four hours later. I tried to talk to her but I guess she didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<p>So yeah, she does not like me. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Anyways, that has somewhat something to do with the black points over
the orange background. Yes, I am referring to hacker news. Specifically,
the points I have accumulated on my profile [0].</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that I do not enjoy reading the orange news anymore. Every
once in a while - more like a shit-more often than before - I&rsquo;ve clicked
on the new section of news. Meaning, even news aren&rsquo;t &lsquo;that&rsquo; ranked but they
appear almost as they are submitted by users all around the globe.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t even find the normal hacker news ranked content nor the show
nor the ask nor the newest news hacker news relevant to me anymore.
Yet I check and check and check and check and check.</p>

<p>A few interesting articles here and there, but I don&rsquo;t finish them. They kinda
bore me to death.</p>

<p>Fortunately, my relationship with that person I was talking about is fine,
but yeah she&rsquo;s told me that I am not liked by her. But she&rsquo;s a very good
person and by no means I would like to ruin our friendship. You are a good
friend Astrid. You too Fatima, for reading my blog and being there and
teaching me chinese.</p>

<p>拜拜</p>

<p>I hope that means bye.</p>
