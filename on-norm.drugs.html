<p>Maybe this is placebo but point is I kind of am a distracted person
and feel like my heart is pounding relatively fast.</p>

<p>Yet today I decided to drink at seven in the <code>p.m.</code> one and a half
cups of american medium-roasted coffee from <em>Garat</em>. and i ate
it with some cookies. maybe too many cookies. Then I started
using my phone like a crazy person and started sending a shit-ton
of links to a friend. Maybe I went overboard with the links.</p>

<p>And the coffee kinda made me happy. I&rsquo;ve never felt this alive before.</p>

<p>Like ideas just flow into my head and I execute them. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just
being very reactive to my vices. Since, yes, being on instagram for like
five hours straight is not healthy. Also, I got on a call with another
friend and helped him out on a school project which I hadn&rsquo;t even started
at the time,
then got him to let me join his team. The code was
almost kind of done, and he made most of it. I feel bad for that. Kinda.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. But maybe without me he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten the last
coding part. We barely saw any programming principles in class.</p>

<p>Also, is it ok to have for dinner only oatmeal with some granola ? And then
take antidepressants and an antibiotic ? I hope I don&rsquo;t fuck up my stomach.</p>

<p>My keyboard definitely makes a ton of noises when typing.</p>
