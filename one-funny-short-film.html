<p>what the film <code>NUMBER 2</code> here:
<a href="https://youtu.be/hZFm6bIqeh8">https://youtu.be/hZFm6bIqeh8</a></p>

    </summary></p>

<p>The film tests the boundaries at which we will conserve
and preserve and save <em>intimacy</em>. And <em>embarassment</em>. I guess
Danish women aren&rsquo;t expected to fart randomly at a supermarket or
in front of a male friend, are they ? Pretty embarassing if you
ask me. I don&rsquo;t understand why she didn&rsquo;t go to the store bathroom;
maybe there wasn&rsquo;t one&hellip;</p>

<p>Of course, we shall discuss other things. Like the fact that she
didn&rsquo;t want to tell her friend that she was actually busy and
instead held a relatively long conversation with her friend.</p>

<p>I guess boundaries go a long way. Just as she did not have the trust
to say I have an emergency she might do that when not feeling safe.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine how humans will work under a society
based on rules and social movements, structures, and just anything
at all. Like how do you define what&rsquo;s acceptable ? is it f'ing ok
to say &ldquo;Hey I have to fucking poop, get out of the way!&rdquo; ? I
would probably say that. Because I&rsquo;m honest, sincere. I appreciate
honesty. I don&rsquo;t like to bluff. If someone wants me out of people&rsquo;s
private conversations and I&rsquo;m there. I won&rsquo;t leave until these
people tell me. And if I get the cue that they&rsquo;re telling me
to gtfo, well then I will tell them ok but to just be direct.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what else to say. Seems like people put big effort into this film.</p>

<p>It uses several examples of embarassment as away
to engage the viewer, or maybe not. Maybe that&rsquo;s the <code>5,4,3,2,1...</code> at the
beginning. That kinda gives us a feeling of fake nostalgia that never
happened. Because who&rsquo;s actually watched a real movie with those countdown
numbers. But now I&rsquo;m criticizing myself for saying &lsquo;real movie&rsquo;. what is
that, anyways? How do you define a good movie ? A good film ? Was
this a short film ? Or just a film ? Would it be bad to name this as
a good film, who decides a good length for a film. Why should the amount
of effort matter or the amount of time or anything at all.</p>

<p>Humans <strong>have reason</strong>. Or a conscience, as we say. We are incapable
of imagining thoughts without being aware of the thoughts themselves.
Very weird indeed. And yet we live in society; we communicate
and have these complex hierarchy instructions that sometimes let
us have more power, and therefore more control, and money.</p>

<p>What is it that we ultimately want in life ? Don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Maybe I went too far on this one. Let me know if this sucks or rocks!</p>
