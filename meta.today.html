<p>Hello. I woke up several times and tried to sleep and turned off my shitty alarms.</p>

<p>Eventually, Joe called. I answered. I understood, my voice was clearly fucked up.
I think I&rsquo;m dehydrated.</p>

<p>Then an alarm started to sound at the same time I was taking the phone call !
What a silly design choice, Apple ! Then I woke up,
went to the bathroom, tried not to die.</p>

<p>I then started committing a lot of changes. Then I pushed. And I pushed.</p>

<p>I got 500'ed by github. What a shame. Github is my go-to remote git provider.
It works over https, aka firewalls don&rsquo;t tell me no. I had some respect for Github.</p>

<p>But I had to push this as fast as I could. So I ssh'ed into my home server,
then created a bare git repo and pushed to that.</p>

<p>Since my friend is in a proxy plus firewalle&rsquo;d network, he couldn&rsquo;t use his ssh keys
so I sent him a link to this:</p>

<p><pre><code>https://git.trevcan.duckdns.org/RobotCode_2022.git/
</code></pre>
And that works over https ! Push doesn&rsquo;t work over http/(s) but yeah. He was
able to pull in no time and could get my code. So that&rsquo;s good I guess.</p>

<p>[0]:  speed running today&rsquo;s [blog]. I should probably eat now, it&rsquo;s 10:30 in the
morning and I haven&rsquo;t attended any of my high school courses. I should go to
tecbot.</p>

<p>Ok, bye</p>
