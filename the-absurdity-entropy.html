<p>note: my friend Gaby thinks that I did not touch entropy enough. Fair enough, <em>I don&rsquo;t really dive into the definition or the concept.</em></p>

<p>Okay, so I just got back from Veracruz. As usual, I am procrastinating
and not doing my calculus assignment; instead, I&rsquo;ll tell you about
a story about entropy, destiny, and I do not know what else.</p>

<p>Okay, so I was in Veracruz, up until Saturday. On Saturday I went away
- with my family - to Tlaxcala, about halfway to where I live.
On Sunday we continued
the route and got to my house. Then we unpacked, my parents told me
to actually get all my stuff up to my room so that they wouldn&rsquo;t take up
that much space in the house. Then we rested for a little bit and
went away to eat, since there wasn&rsquo;t much food in the house. We had
been away for about a week.</p>

<p>Then, while we were in the car, I realized
I was <strong>not</strong> wearing my seatbelt. Weird thing was that this SUV always
beeps with a very fucking high pitch when someone does not have their seatbelt
on.</p>

<p>But how might the vehicle detect if someone is not using their seatbelt ?
Well, the seatbelt buckle is made of metal, so maybe there&rsquo;s two terminals in
the seatbelt socket that close a circuit. And it only beeps if there&rsquo;s weight
on the seat. But the thing is that if you&rsquo;re already in the car - without
your seatbelt- and then you start the car, the car will think that you&rsquo;re just
a load, meaning it won&rsquo;t complain if you do not have your seatbelt on. All of
this I am assuming from my very few experiences in this SUV, in (or on?)
the passenger seat.</p>

<p>So, anyways, I am going out to eat. In this car, with my family. I do not
have my seatbelt on. Then I think, what are the odds that we crash while I
do not have my seatbelt on ? Hmmm, who knows I think. Just a not-so-odd
thought that popped into my head. All of a sudden, a car from the other side
of the road - who was going in the opposite direction - just turned and gased
the pedal and went into our side of the road while my dad was going through
a green. I think she wanted to park but wanted to have better visibility when
exiting. So she ( I think ) was going to go left, would then backup and align
to
the parking spot. Which is- as you might expect- perpendicular to the road.</p>

<p>So then my father pressed the brakes so hard that I could have died. Nah, just
joking, I don&rsquo;t think I would have died. Maybe if I had been in the middle
seat. But I was on the right-passenger seat. Without my seatbelt. So my
reflexes came in and I just started to try and make tension with my legs and
push towards the copilot seat so that my legs would take the force of the
sudden breaking and I wouldn&rsquo;t have a bruise on my head. So yeah, that&rsquo;s that.
Then my father started to bash the horn so hard that it was probably heard on
the whole intersection and maybe several meters away.</p>

<p>yeah, entropy is so fucking weird. What was the probability that whilst I was
thinking the probability of being in a crash whilst not wearing my seatbelt
I would crash ? Probably a whole fucking lot. But hey, maybe math or
statistics people will tell me that I&rsquo;m an asshole for not wearing my seatbelt
because the probability is reasonably high because just look at the birthday
paradox. The probablity that 100 people will have the same birthday is super
high even though there&rsquo;s 365 days to choose from.</p>

<p>I do not know what else to say. Maybe I will blog later in the day, I will
try to stop procrastinating now. arrivederci, my dudeees. ( my fork
of the <code>it's wednesday my dudeees...</code> vine ).</p>
