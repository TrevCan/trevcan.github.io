<p>Yesterday - well, technically the day before yesterday a.k.a. <em>antier</em> in Spanish -
me and some friends were sharing stories of how we got into Tecbot, the
robotics team I am a member of. We were
tired after a long day of working, testing the robot; building stuff; realizing
that X or Y doesn&rsquo;t work; trying to find x or y thing for this problem; then
realizing again that it was there the whole time behind some backpacks or whatever.</p>

<p>Anyways, we got to this kid. His name is Velasco. He is in 2nd semester of high
school. In other words, he&rsquo;s a freshman. He tried to get into tecbot since
middle school, in 9th grade. People
referred him to X teacher. Teacher did not respond his emails. None. Nada. none
at all. Maybe his institutional teacher account had some corporate spam
email filters so maybe he never actually received it ! So he got tired and
eventually got into the high school were the robotics team was.</p>

<p>But this was all during the pandemic so he barely got to be in the
high school buildings.</p>

<p>He tried emailing him again. And again. He seemed busy. He did not respond.
Yet Santiago figured out the name of the teacher, then ( somehow ) got his
zoom handle and started to get into his meetings at random times.</p>

<p>Eventually he figured out at which times he had to give classes and at
which times he actually gave Tecbot. The head coach, X, is more like the
manager. He knows some things here and there, I think he&rsquo;s an engineer
but hasn&rsquo;t practiced in a long time. He isn&rsquo;t actually one of the mentors
giving technical advice - well, sometimes he actually <strong>is</strong>. So Velasco
eventually figured out who the mentors were - that&rsquo;s what we call them -
and started to take electrical courses. This includes from resistance,
raw formulas to actual real wiring of the robot, soddering, managing
batteries, cables, and a shit-load of other things.</p>

<p>For this Velasco, I admire you. I somewhat remember when I got into
tecbot. But I don&rsquo;t think it was this hard for me. I actually tried
getting into tecbot at the same age as you did - when I was in 9th
grade. But it wasn&rsquo;t this hard. My best friend had a brother who
was attending that high school and that robotics team. He was - at
the time - the season driver ! So yeah, I was able to get in
pretty easily. But I very much appreciate that you are now in
the team.</p>

<p>You told us and made us realize that showing up and doing things
is more important than being on a list. There was never and will
never be any list. If you have enough dedication to go through
all this and more, you can and will and are going to be able
to do anything you want.</p>

<p>This post is for you,</p>

<p>Velasco.</p>
