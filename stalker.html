<p>I watched Stalker(1979), a Russian film
recommended to me by Miranda. It was
hard to watch at first, I constantly
looking for consistent meaning and
then I started contemplating it. That
is when I started to appreciate the film.</p>

<p>I watched it in two sittings. In the
first sitting my Father was with me, we
watched about 30% of the film. Then I
watched it the next night and I am
writing my review of it just after I&rsquo;ve
watched the film so I don&rsquo;t forget most
of my thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>Spoilers ahead.</strong></p>

<p>I wrote some things in my notebook:</p>

<ul>
<li>KEEP GOING! you will end up nowhere!</li>
<li>DRY TUNNEL</li>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine as I am.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;All this is is someone&rsquo;s idiotic
invention, don&rsquo;t you feel it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Eternal Jew (???no idea what this means)</li>
<li>You have to believe</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write about this film. I haven&rsquo;t
written an intricate things as this in more than three months I&rsquo;d say. There&rsquo;s plenty to say.</p>

<p>The film starts off with a kinda bald guy in his room with
his wife and daughter. They are all sleeping
on the same bed with the daughter between them. They live
in quite poor conditions, their house is extremely near,
if not below the traintracks. The sound is loud, clearly
loud and the vibrations are not behind. Things will start
to move when the train comes and it won&rsquo;t go away for
at least a minute, more like a couple. Then the
bald guy starts putting some clothes on, the wife complains
about his job, explaining that he should not be doing that.
The guy says he has to and leaves. He meets some people,
then they plan an escape. An escape to go away from their town
to the ZONE. Well, before that they meet at a bar to talk
about who they are and they talk a little in the ZONE. I don&rsquo;t
know if it was just me but sometimes it was very complicated
to know who was talking, like their mouths didn&rsquo;t move that much
and they did not do any gestures whatsoever and sometimes the
shots were too far away for the movements of the mouth to be
perceived. Maybe that&rsquo;s just the doing of Tarkovsky (Andrei
Tarkovsky, the director of the film).</p>

<p>Then they escape after using a vehicle with the top off and then
they use one of those locomotives that is on the train tracks
and choo choo bitch offf they go. There&rsquo;s a few bullets here and
there. No one get&rsquo;s injured I think. Then they get somewhere.
They gotta lose the lil' choo choo thing because that is the way.</p>

<p>The bald guy is the leader. The other&rsquo;s are there to go to the
Room in the Zone. The bald guy has been hired as their guide. He
explains to them that they are in the Zone and in the Zone lives
no one and the ZONEEEEeee is very special so they gotta be
careful about everything they do. Whatever they think is the
right way to do things or the right way to go is probably never
the first answer, he says. They gotta go the long way if they
want to survive. So they take longer than usual. Then one
of the guys forgets something, goes for it then is waiting for
them with a fucking <em>fogata</em> (fire) with the stuff he had forgotten
and then they go and the Writer guy keeps complaining why he
always has to go first and then they go into some kind of giant
shit hole with water, looks nasty but they do it anyways. They get
scared sometimes because of the sounds, then they almost get to
the room when the Professor pulls out a fucking bomb and says
this Zone, this room has no meaning that no one could ever grant
him the inner-most wish he&rsquo;d want. Ah well I forgot to say the bald
guy, the guide tells them that they&rsquo;ll go in the room and think
of their inner-most wish the one that&rsquo;s really inside of their gut
and also to think of their whole lives leading to this point and
so they kinda refuse and they go on to rant that this is
just some bullshit thing that it has no meaning and they
want to bomb the fucking place down because if they don&rsquo;t like
it no one can like and it&rsquo;s good that they are destroying this guy&rsquo;s
business cause why not. Then they cancel the bomb thing, don&rsquo;t
bomb anything, none of them go into the room for their wish to be
granted they return as normal. They see that the bald guy&rsquo;s daughter
can&rsquo;t walk. The wife says that he married the right guy and some
shit that this is destiny and they&rsquo;re happy. the daughter has
some mighty magic and can move stuff like glasses of water n' shit.</p>

<p>*end of movie*</p>

<h2>review</h2>

<p>At this point I don&rsquo;t really know what to say. I enjoyed about 70%
of the film it has some really good phrases. I watched it in Russian
with English subtitles from opensubtitles, maybe there&rsquo;s a better
translation somewhere. I need to watch it again when I&rsquo;m not depressed
of life. I don&rsquo;t think I felt as if this movie changed my life forever
but it <strong>did</strong> remind me that I have to believe in something, in myself,
in someone, in a dream, in <strong>ANYTHING</strong>! Maybe I&rsquo;ll update
the review</p>

<p>I liked it. Thanks for the recommendation, Miranda.</p>

<p>The end.</p>
