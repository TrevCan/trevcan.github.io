<p>Oh my God ! It&rsquo;s my last day of school ! Well, I still
have another day tomorrow but we&rsquo;re practically doing nothing!
I still have like 3 final exams that I&rsquo;ll be doing this Friday
or the next week.</p>

<p>But whateveeeer ! Today I&rsquo;ve given myself the day.
I had a &lsquo;fiesta de cereal&rsquo; (yes, a cereal party) !
Everyone just brought a ton of sugary cereals, milk, almond milk,
other kinds of liquids that are called milk but I don&rsquo;t think
are actually milk, toppings, spoons, bowls, and glasses for drinking
and apparently serving the cereal !?</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t really feel that good. I feel kinda bad because I
was supposed to bring cereal and other stuff but I did not.</p>

<p>But now I feel bored. Yet with self-guilt, because I am not doing
what I am supposed to. I have some not-yet-done calculus assignments
that are not difficult, yet too easy. And that doesn&rsquo;t motivate me
to keep on going. I&rsquo;ve probably already passed the subject, and now
I just need to take the final exam and if I want finish those
calculus exercises. Which will most likely serve as practice, which
does help.</p>

<p>But why am I here? Just to suffer ? Who knooowwws mate! Also, I watched
a tv show for the first time in a while. And with another human
being. With a friend, actually. I watched the 2nd episode of
Mr. Robot (2016).
I&rsquo;ve already finished the show, yes, the whole four seasons. It really
brings out very dark yet astonishing thoughts within your mind. I
don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because I could spoil it. If you want
to watch it it&rsquo;s available on amazon prime. But hey, if you don&rsquo;t
want to give your money to one of the biggest e-commerce shopping
conglomerates around the world just send me an e-mail and maybe I&rsquo;ll
let you copy off the downloaded episodes I have. (Don&rsquo;t worry, I
still pay for amazon prime and I did watch it there first so -some -
money will definitely be going to the actors/director, etc&hellip;)</p>

<p>And the scenes. The writing style of the show. Very beautiful. Or
maybe I&rsquo;m just so fucking biased and I praise this show like
no other because I haven&rsquo;t watched that many dramas. Well, I&rsquo;ve also
watched House M.D. Yep, the whole eight seasons, baby! It gets boring
after a while. But point is, Mr. Robot is. And if you want you
may watch it, but I must say it does include sensitive and/or
disturbing content.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s what a good show is, right ? One that actually questions
your being, existence and merely mixes you in with the feelings
and does not merely end and your mind says: &ldquo;Oh well we&rsquo;re done here.&rdquo;
No, your mind <strong>Will want more</strong>!.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough blogging for today, plus dependencies.</p>

<p>So no, I&rsquo;m not done bloggging yet.</p>

<a name="dependencies"></a>
<h1>dependencies</h1>

<p>Dependencies are weird. This is some kind of buzz-word. A real
one, actually. It stands for what it means. At least in software.
A software, a program, or a set of programs, may depend upon other
programs to function. Libraries, let&rsquo;s say. Frameworks, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s this thing called dependency hell, from the internet
discussions I&rsquo;ve read it&rsquo;s mostly within the front-end web developing
space. But it could also happen in the backend. Certain software
requires certain, very specific, cryptic - even -,
versions of the software and sometimes software collides with other
software. Libraries are just collections of minified code (sometimes
not even minified) or maybe even compiled and using a shared library.
But there&rsquo;s just a gigantic web of tech stacks that we utilize on a
daily basis. That is why I strive for minimalism within my life.</p>

<p>Although sometimes extreme minimalism may lead to extreme dependencies,
which I am trying to - most definitely - get away from. Are friends
dependencies ? definitely !! They most of the time are. We sometimes
need them. Friends are there when needed, right ? But sometimes
they&rsquo;re always needed. Of course, that is bad, that&rsquo;s dependency hell.</p>

<p>Sometimes your thoughts wander way too much and you don&rsquo;t have time
to talk that much to people yet you&rsquo;d love to talk more and more and
more yet time is of the essence. And so is my life and so is theirs.</p>

<p>But generating dependencies is sometimes bad. when some of the code
is very simple to make, but tedious, you may go to using libraries.
But if a develper rants about not being paid enough money and
shutting down all his very minimalist packages and shutting down
very popular web services that says that something&rsquo;s very wrong
in the developer space. Not only for the fact that this guy&rsquo;s not
being paid enough ( which is meh ), but also because the developers
who were using <strong>his</strong> code did not plan ahead.</p>

<p>But hey, take my comments with a fucking grain of salt cause I&rsquo;m
still in high school if that counts. But maybe I&rsquo;ll get a headstart,
I&rsquo;m trying to get an internship.</p>
