<p>Nothing new, I guess.</p>

<p>Why am I making this blog post ? Well, I&rsquo;m dumb.
No, I&rsquo;m not dumb. I&rsquo;m just trying to have an inner
conversation and some kind of introspection to understand
what is going on, man!</p>

<p>Why am I like this ??</p>

<p>Why do I self-sabotage ( is it with j or g ? oh yeah in
english it&rsquo;s definitely with <code>g</code>, right ? )  ??? !!!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t self-sabotage Hector!</p>

<p>You promised Tim that you&rsquo;d be good enough and work
on time. He has been nothing less than tolerant with you !
And that&rsquo;s a good thing. Seems like a nice guy.</p>

<p>Honestly, some people warned me that it could be a scam and
that I&rsquo;d be tutoring for free whilst he&rsquo;d be selling ads on
the discord chat or whatever. <strong> But it isn&rsquo;t a scam!! </strong></p>

<p>This person is real. He works a real job. Kinda boring, but
not boring to death. But he created this foundation that
helps highschool kids learn programming and also career-changing
adults to learn technology and get into coding jobs.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s good. And I&rsquo;ve met good people. Yet I have barely done
any work.</p>

<p>I promised Tim, I promised some friends I&rsquo;d do stuff; yet I haven&rsquo;t
done it !! Why, hector ?</p>

<p>Why are you still here ?!?! just writing this shit out on the
vim text editor which you think is cool because george hotz (a.k.a.
<code>geohot</code> or <code>t0mcr00se</code> ) talked about it <strong>ONCE</strong> on a recorded
live stream that you did not pay for and now I use it ! But it&rsquo;s
cool because I&rsquo;m a Linux guy, right ? I think I got into Linux because
of George, so thanks for that george. And george was also the guy
who introduced my to tiling window managers when I was first starting
out with Linux.</p>

<p>I tried out XMonad, actually.</p>

<p>But <strong>again</strong>, why the fuck am I still writing here !?!?!?!</p>

<p>Just get to work, man! don&rsquo;t try to get people&rsquo;s attention if you don&rsquo;t
deserve it.</p>

<p>No, fortunately I&rsquo;m not suicidal. Am I a pathological liar ? No, I
am a doer. Hector, you are a doer. You promise stuff.</p>

<p>When you don&rsquo;t achieve it, you should be honest with yourself and with
the people you promised it to. You should let them know that you&rsquo;re
a procrastinator - a professional procrastinator. Oh, God!
WHy would you even say that you are a <em>professional</em> procrastinator.?!?!?!?</p>

<p>What the hell does that even mean !? No, man. You are sabotaging yourself,
your relationships, your careeer.</p>

<p>Calm the fuck down, Hector.</p>

<p>Put your server on a fucking etc/hosts file and get over it !</p>

<p>Just to brag, this is my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file right now:</p>

<p><pre><code># Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1     localhost
127.0.0.1   t490-4rch.localdomain   t490-4rch   
0.0.0.0     news.ycombinator.com
0.0.0.0     lobste.rs
0.0.0.0     wikipedia.org
0.0.0.0     en.wikipedia.org
0.0.0.0     web.whatsapp.com
0.0.0.0     duckduckgo.com

</code></pre>
that is all. Maybe i&rsquo;ll add my server here after pushing this blog post
and just ignore it.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll try to as be zen as possible.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t even spell-check this shit, man.</p>

<p>Mistakes are made, and you probably aready know that I&rsquo;d have
corrected them or maybe I did not or ma8ybe I will.jjj1</p>
