<p>Instead of working I have found myself dealing
with some mysery and happiness.
Lots of both sometimes.
I miss things.
I think I miss writing.
I like writing at the two a.m. in the morning because why not.</p>

<p>Anyways, I recently bought myself something that actually uses the usb-c
port on my computer. The USB-C connection actually has a Thunderbolt 3
controller and yes, in theory, I could just connect literally everything
I&rsquo;d possibly ever need through that cable.</p>

<p>I went to a Best Buy in Michigan to get a thunderbolt 3 capable dock
but to my surprise I did not find any of my liking. The thing that was
missing the most was a Display Port. Literally none of them had it.
Not even the extra expensive ones. I mean, they were all kinda equally
expensive, even though they&rsquo;re probably as shitty as one would expect
from too new technologies and not enough real manufacturing of them.</p>

<p>In the past month I stumbled upon a hacker news post talking about
thunderbolt 3 was.
The conclusion was that the expensive and ali-express bought docks
were just as equally likely to fail, not work at all, and or work
at advertised speeds.</p>

<p>Anyways, I did find some interesting stuff at the best buy. I found a
micro-SD card reader that has both a USB type A (that&rsquo;s the regular
USB port you&rsquo;re used to) and a USB type C port. That&rsquo;s nice,
maybe I&rsquo;ll gift it to my sister who both owns a regular laptop without
USB type C and an iPad with a USB type C connector, hopefully this will
work if she has to transfer files faster.</p>

<p>So I did buy that, I bought it <em>open box</em> <a href="#references">[0]</a>!
I know, I&rsquo;m a cheap, ain&rsquo;t I ?
Also, I bought a 100-watt USB-C power adaptor for my computer, to charge
it much, much faster. As a bonus, it has a 20-watt <a href="#references">[1]</a>
type-c port and a usb type-a with a little more amperage than your
regular phone brick.</p>

<p>Anyways, I bought these two products. The power adaptor worked great.
I can now fast-charge off a single AC connection three devices at the
same time! Pretty neat. We&rsquo;ll see how hot she gets.</p>

<p>The micro-SD card reader did not work.
Well, the USB type-A connector did work. So that&rsquo;s good. I could access
the file system off my only not-lost micro-SD card and can play
the files just as well as I would on my computer&rsquo;s port.
But the type-C connection wouldn&rsquo;t work.
One of my first ideas was to try on a proprietary operating system
that normies call Windows.
(un?)Fortunately, same results. Only type-A would work.
Although something interesting was that power would indeed work.
I could charge my phone off the port easily. But I could not read
any data off any devices.</p>

<p>So I thought maybe BIOS drivers but wtf am  ieven saying idk. Idk
enough to know if the BIOS is in charge of this or not. Maybe Lenovo
weird firmware updates ?! I checked but nothing. Just annoying windows 10
fat updates. Some Linux stackoverflow questions pointed in weird directions.</p>

<a name="the-culprit"></a>
<h1>the culprit</h1>

<p>the culprit
is that&hellip;
well&hellip; not-so-long ago I delved into my BIOS settings and chose to disable
the THunderbolt 3 port.
To my surprise, power was not cut-off the port and still worked like a
charger and I therefore expected it to still be working.
But in fact I just jumped into my BIOS a few minutes ago and lo and behold
there it was the Thunderbolt 3 disable setting!
turned it right back up, worked like a charm.
Even if the connection
was not over thunderbolt 3, it encapsulates the type-C data port as well,
so that&rsquo;s that. Now I can access my micro-sd through an adapter connected
to a USB-C port that is accessed by a mostly open-source operating system.</p>

<p>nice.</p>

<h2>references</h2>

<ul>
<li>[0] &ldquo;<em>open box</em>&rdquo;. - I&rsquo;ve never heard of this term
until a friend of mine who lives in the United States told me.
It means that a human presumably opened a product but did not use it.
Then this human returned the product and it is advertised on the price tags
with a discount and a label that says &ldquo;open box&rdquo;. I bought this thingy for like
15 bucks (no tax), like 10 off. Has worked well enough so far.</li>
<li>[1]
fast-charging baby!
which only my dad will get to use because i have an iPhone 6s which fits my
needs. I&rsquo;d love to jailbreak it. Or maybe not ?
Every time I think of doing it I don&rsquo;t have the correct iOS version for it
to work and I kinda don&rsquo;t want to possibly install  malware onto my phone.
WHy am I playing the devil&rsquo;s advocate - and not - every time I think of this ?</li>
</ul>
