<p>For some strange fucking reason, I feel satisfied.
I am not sad.
I feel like I&rsquo;ve done enough of a purpose to myself and society and to my family. At least for today.
I&rsquo;ve talked to friends, maybe not as much as I like but whatever.</p>

<p>Today I drove. A lot. I drove in highways, strange fucking race-car-like roads that are technically in the state where I live !</p>

<p>I liked driving.
I went to one of my dad&rsquo;s friends from work apartment with my mom and dad, we were invited to a dinner.
He lives in some kind of a paradise.
There&rsquo;s a supermarket in his gated community ! It&rsquo;s gigantic ! There&rsquo;s so many houses surrounded  by the woods. Looks like a lotta rich people live there.</p>

<p>Not necessarily high-class rich people but middle-high class who still work but do a pretty nice living.
Guy&rsquo;s living the dream.</p>

<p>I mean, this guy lives in an apartment.
It&rsquo;s a nice living I suppose.
there are many people with houses there so I suppose
he&rsquo;s technically one of the &lsquo;poor&rsquo;
from there but he sure seems to be making
shit-loads of money. good for him!</p>

<p>anyways, i think I&rsquo;m making this too much about him.
and this is about me. i felt satisfied because, well&hellip; maybe because
I drove
or maybe because I did homework.</p>

<p>Or maybe cause I talked to a good friend
whom I&rsquo;ve known for not so much time but still provides
great influence over intellectual
curiosity and over
my mind.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. what, is this an essay?
am i supposed to end formally
if i am to be a professional writer ?
hmmm, that&rsquo;ll be a question for
another day to answer&hellip;.
or maybe you could
answer it and tell me how i
should live my life.</p>
