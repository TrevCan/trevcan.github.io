What?

Hello, world!

What am i doing here? what am i doing now ? 
i do not really know. i can tell that i am writing.
i am writing on a text editor, on vim, on an operating
system called linux.

but how do i feel? because for some reason i keep thinking
and thinking and thinking. but sometimes none of that thinking
sticks.

i think too much. i am a person with ideas that flow. i am
not directing those ideas anywhere, really. why don't i?

i don't know, i am unsure. i am writing to remind myself that
i used to do this, write. I used to write on my blog.

maybe someone will read it, maybe someone will not. i also
want to remind myself this blod, it is a record of some
of my thoughts and should act as an archive of my mind. 
of the structure of it. or maybe not at all. some articles
are highly edited, some are just written as i'm thinking
about them. varies by a lot.

anyways, there's some people i've met. in these short
two weeks i've met tons of people. maybe my expectations were too
high and i expected people with too much of me, with too much
of my breed.

but i've learned that there's variety. i've met people. hopefully
someone reads this and finds meaning in some of the thoughts
said herein (is this the right fancy way to use this word?).
