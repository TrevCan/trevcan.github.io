Not on the melancholy hill


For some strange fucking reason, I feel satisfied.
I am not sad.
I feel like I've done enough of a purpose to myself and society and to my family. At least for today.
I've talked to friends, maybe not as much as I like but whatever.

Today I drove. A lot. I drove in highways, strange fucking race-car-like roads that are technically in the state where I live !

I liked driving. 
I went to one of my dad's friends from work apartment with my mom and dad, we were invited to a dinner.
He lives in some kind of a paradise.
There's a supermarket in his gated community ! It's gigantic ! There's so many houses surrounded  by the woods. Looks like a lotta rich people live there.

Not necessarily high-class rich people but middle-high class who still work but do a pretty nice living.
Guy's living the dream.

I mean, this guy lives in an apartment.
It's a nice living I suppose. 
there are many people with houses there so I suppose
he's technically one of the 'poor'
from there but he sure seems to be making
shit-loads of money. good for him!

anyways, i think I'm making this too much about him.
and this is about me. i felt satisfied because, well... maybe because
I drove
or maybe because I did homework.

Or maybe cause I talked to a good friend 
whom I've known for not so much time but still provides
great influence over intellectual
curiosity and over
my mind. 

That's it. what, is this an essay?
am i supposed to end formally
if i am to be a professional writer ?
hmmm, that'll be a question for
another day to answer....
or maybe you could
answer it and tell me how i 
should live my life.
