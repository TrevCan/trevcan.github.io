On a chaotic mind or mind chaos

March 23, 2023. More than one and a half year later, I am here to write this.
I don't even remember anything of what I was going to write. 

Today is now Saturday, January the fourth, **2025**!. Yes, 2025.
Can u believe it!?!?! I barely can!

Yesterday I went to Mexico City to get a typewriter (yes, those ancient
beautiful machines) fixed. I could not find any shops
near were I live. The nearest one was in Mexico City.

So I went there. And there it was. A shop. A workshop. Its banner
barely said anything about typewriters.
The business itself is more tailored to the fixing of printing machines,
the newer machines that have become the norm in almost every house with a
computer. You have a computer, you are to print. And if you didn't have
a printer at home you wen't to the stationery store. In Spanish this is
a *papelería*. And I also had with me another machine which I had been
almost using daily for about two weeks or so now. And that one worked
almost flawlessly. Maybe every 300 characters or so it slightly jammed,
it was easy getting it to work again but it did need some cleaning
which I am not trusting myself to do but more a professional.

I was with my father and we were in awe as a professional artisan took
a look at each and every single one of the compact heavy machines we
brought to him. He inspected them, carefully but firmly pressed
each key as to see what could possibly be wrong, checked some gears,
lever-looking metal things, the roller which rolls the paper after
doing a return-carriage.

I hope for them to be ready in a week or so. We'll see. For now I'll have
to settle writing on my Laptop, a Thinkpad T490. I should name this
beast, should you come up with a suitable name please contact me.

I also spent time with my Father as we visited the downtown of Mexico City,
near the big government buildings like the Mail Office and the Supreme
Court of Justice. We were going to eat in a tavern, a place where you
usually drank some kind of alcohol and they served you the food of the
day, you got another drink, they served you more food, usually the next
course. We were expecting to go to a *cantina*, *canteen*, *tavern*,
*bar-looking* place but no. To our delight we were greeted with a fancy
restaurant with extremely nice food. Nice waiters and a lot of history
with cloths framed to the walls with fancy signatures, writings,
and drawings of famous people. And my Dad and I talked about
things, not that much but it was a start. A better start than most I'd
say. Than most starts I've ever had in my life. I don't know if I'll
ever have day as beautiful as yesterday. But it was also horrible in
some sense. After we ate, I drove us to a tyre shop to the west of
Mexico City. After we arrived, my nose started to shut down as it
got more and more inflammated (irritated). It got red, it got stuffy,
it was harder and harder to breath, sneeze after sneeze, mucus
after mucus. Paper, more toilet paper, washing hands a lot. Going to the
bathroom a lot as I did not carry any tissue paper with me at the time.

But we also heard some nice tunes I'd say on the way to the tyre shop.
I don't remember which specifically. Nah, I'm lying. I do remember
some Radiohead in there, and that's really all I remember.

I will now cut to the end and leave you in suspense to show how a great
storyteller I am (out of ideas).

So that's that. And hopefully today will be a beautiful day to you to!
