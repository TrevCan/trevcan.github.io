On a bus.

Today, hello. I am writing slightly uncomfortably 
on a moving bus. It looks small from the back. But it's 
indeed a relatively large bus. It is the first time I use 
one of these tables. There are tables for eight passengers.
Always at the back. Are they eight tables? Or just two?
They seem to be two. Since on each side of the bus there are
four seats, two seats facing another two seats. With a table
in the middle. And then there are these little arm/tablerests on top
of the big table
with hinges attached to it. And they say not to put your
arms over it. But that's really what it's for. Maybe they mean your
full weight or something.

Anyways, apparently there is WiFi. I've never used the WiFi on this bus.
I like to be out of connection when being on a bus.

Although calls do come in every once in a while. From my parents, mostly.
I haven't written in a big while. My last post must be more than a month old,
I think. Esteban read it, thank you Esteban.

Waht to write about? So many thoughts on my mind. The sound is ever-so 
increasingly  loud. Metal banging against plastic, I think. Or maybe metal 
against metal and some plastic in there. I just feel like this experience is 
weird.

There's a movie playing on the bus with the (probably main) character being played
by the guy who is in many Wes Anderson movies. With an oval face. There's a guy 
with a Macintosh sitting near me. He is in the section with tables. He's on the left
side of the bus. But he's the closest one to the aisle. I'm also next to the aisle,
but on the right side of the bus and sitting at the back. He's sitting one seat
before the back.

I think this is the first time in a while that I don't sleep on a bus. It has been
a while. I remembered it quieter. I believe the transmission and motor stuff
are just more audible in the back of the bus than say, the front. 

This is a good start. end for now.
