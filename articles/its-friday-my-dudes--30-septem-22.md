Today is Friday my dudes ! 

Hello Stranger. I am me. And i'm blogging.

I feel kinda bad, ok ? 

Should I ? I don't know.
I enjoyed all this.
The human mind works in very mysterious ways...
**insert another lame cliché here**

I don't even know how to feel. 
i don't know what to think.
The only thing that I know for certain is that I've balanced
my wrong-doings.

Last Tuesday I lied. I gave into a lie.
But I'm an honest person, yet I had the choice to not choose
to lie.
But I fucking did!!
And I'm not saying it's the other person's fault for suggesting
_to lie_ but in fact, it was my fault.
Cause it's my life, my part in the lie!, am I right ? 

Well yeah, of course I'm right and if I'm not say it to me by whichever
means you consider, ok ? 

Now, today I think I've redeemed myself by not lying and by doing
the exact opposite of what happened if I lied. 

And I feel good about it. 

At least I know that, so let's not forget that, alright ? 

I like falling in love. It was a nice experience.
I would do it again, many many times.
