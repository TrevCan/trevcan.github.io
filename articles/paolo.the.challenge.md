$ whois trevor. featuring guest author

Hello. This is a challenge for Paolo. I hope you read this, Paolo.
You are an interesting human being, you know more about me than what I know
about what you know about me, because I have barely talked to you and you,
too, have barely talked. Words. Mouths. Saliva. Syllables. Ideas, brain
gew, brain stew.

Your challenge is here. Now. You should provide your public ssh-key for
repository access through e-mail (`heror0 4 8 4 [ a t ] pr ot onmai l.com` 
without spaces it's just so that the web scrapers don't catch on to this email.
)
. **Your task is to edit this article**
and ***say anything you want about me***. I invite you to write in any language
you choose, could be more than one. You can say as little or as much as
you'd like. Your preference. I would love to see a story about myself
through the eyes of an interested reader of my blog. you may add images, 
drawings, etcetera. you should make all hyperlinks relative to the `data/`
directory, e.g. I have an image `data/asdf/img` and you should reference
it in this markdown file in html as `asdf/img`.

you can preview the whole blog using the `make all` command from the
repo directory. it should run fine in any sane linux machine, just make
sure to have the dependencies.
Then you can browse the outputted contents in `www/index.html`
. Should you have any trouble, the blog server will deploy every time you
push to git. Good luck!
