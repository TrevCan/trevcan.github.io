<p>Hello. This is a challenge for Paolo. I hope you read this, Paolo.
You are an interesting human being, you know more about me than what I know
about what you know about me, because I have barely talked to you and you,
too, have barely talked. Words. Mouths. Saliva. Syllables. Ideas, brain
gew, brain stew.</p>

<p>Your challenge is here. Now. You should provide your public ssh-key for
repository access through e-mail (<code>heror0 4 8 4 [ a t ] pr ot onmai l.com</code>
without spaces it&rsquo;s just so that the web scrapers don&rsquo;t catch on to this email.
)
. <strong>Your task is to edit this article</strong>
and <strong><em>say anything you want about me</em></strong>. I invite you to write in any language
you choose, could be more than one. You can say as little or as much as
you&rsquo;d like. Your preference. I would love to see a story about myself
through the eyes of an interested reader of my blog. you may add images,
drawings, etcetera. you should make all hyperlinks relative to the <code>data/</code>
directory, e.g. I have an image <code>data/asdf/img</code> and you should reference
it in this markdown file in html as <code>asdf/img</code>.</p>

<p>you can preview the whole blog using the <code>make all</code> command from the
repo directory. it should run fine in any sane linux machine, just make
sure to have the dependencies.
Then you can browse the outputted contents in <code>www/index.html</code>
. Should you have any trouble, the blog server will deploy every time you
push to git. Good luck!</p>

<p>I watched Stalker(1979), a Russian film
recommended to me by Miranda. It was
hard to watch at first, I constantly
looking for consistent meaning and
then I started contemplating it. That
is when I started to appreciate the film.</p>

<p>I watched it in two sittings. In the
first sitting my Father was with me, we
watched about 30% of the film. Then I
watched it the next night and I am
writing my review of it just after I&rsquo;ve
watched the film so I don&rsquo;t forget most
of my thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>Spoilers ahead.</strong></p>

<p>I wrote some things in my notebook:</p>

<ul>
<li>KEEP GOING! you will end up nowhere!</li>
<li>DRY TUNNEL</li>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine as I am.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;All this is is someone&rsquo;s idiotic
invention, don&rsquo;t you feel it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Eternal Jew (???no idea what this means)</li>
<li>You have to believe</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write about this film. I haven&rsquo;t
written an intricate things as this in more than three months I&rsquo;d say. There&rsquo;s plenty to say.</p>

<p>The film starts off with a kinda bald guy in his room with
his wife and daughter. They are all sleeping
on the same bed with the daughter between them. They live
in quite poor conditions, their house is extremely near,
if not below the traintracks. The sound is loud, clearly
loud and the vibrations are not behind. Things will start
to move when the train comes and it won&rsquo;t go away for
at least a minute, more like a couple. Then the
bald guy starts putting some clothes on, the wife complains
about his job, explaining that he should not be doing that.
The guy says he has to and leaves. He meets some people,
then they plan an escape. An escape to go away from their town
to the ZONE. Well, before that they meet at a bar to talk
about who they are and they talk a little in the ZONE. I don&rsquo;t
know if it was just me but sometimes it was very complicated
to know who was talking, like their mouths didn&rsquo;t move that much
and they did not do any gestures whatsoever and sometimes the
shots were too far away for the movements of the mouth to be
perceived. Maybe that&rsquo;s just the doing of Tarkovsky (Andrei
Tarkovsky, the director of the film).</p>

<p>Then they escape after using a vehicle with the top off and then
they use one of those locomotives that is on the train tracks
and choo choo bitch offf they go. There&rsquo;s a few bullets here and
there. No one get&rsquo;s injured I think. Then they get somewhere.
They gotta lose the lil' choo choo thing because that is the way.</p>

<p>The bald guy is the leader. The other&rsquo;s are there to go to the
Room in the Zone. The bald guy has been hired as their guide. He
explains to them that they are in the Zone and in the Zone lives
no one and the ZONEEEEeee is very special so they gotta be
careful about everything they do. Whatever they think is the
right way to do things or the right way to go is probably never
the first answer, he says. They gotta go the long way if they
want to survive. So they take longer than usual. Then one
of the guys forgets something, goes for it then is waiting for
them with a fucking <em>fogata</em> (fire) with the stuff he had forgotten
and then they go and the Writer guy keeps complaining why he
always has to go first and then they go into some kind of giant
shit hole with water, looks nasty but they do it anyways. They get
scared sometimes because of the sounds, then they almost get to
the room when the Professor pulls out a fucking bomb and says
this Zone, this room has no meaning that no one could ever grant
him the inner-most wish he&rsquo;d want. Ah well I forgot to say the bald
guy, the guide tells them that they&rsquo;ll go in the room and think
of their inner-most wish the one that&rsquo;s really inside of their gut
and also to think of their whole lives leading to this point and
so they kinda refuse and they go on to rant that this is
just some bullshit thing that it has no meaning and they
want to bomb the fucking place down because if they don&rsquo;t like
it no one can like and it&rsquo;s good that they are destroying this guy&rsquo;s
business cause why not. Then they cancel the bomb thing, don&rsquo;t
bomb anything, none of them go into the room for their wish to be
granted they return as normal. They see that the bald guy&rsquo;s daughter
can&rsquo;t walk. The wife says that he married the right guy and some
shit that this is destiny and they&rsquo;re happy. the daughter has
some mighty magic and can move stuff like glasses of water n' shit.</p>

<p>*end of movie*</p>

<a name="review"></a>
<h2>review</h2>

<p>At this point I don&rsquo;t really know what to say. I enjoyed about 70%
of the film it has some really good phrases. I watched it in Russian
with English subtitles from opensubtitles, maybe there&rsquo;s a better
translation somewhere. I need to watch it again when I&rsquo;m not depressed
of life. I don&rsquo;t think I felt as if this movie changed my life forever
but it <strong>did</strong> remind me that I have to believe in something, in myself,
in someone, in a dream, in <strong>ANYTHING</strong>! Maybe I&rsquo;ll update
the review</p>

<p>I liked it. Thanks for the recommendation, Miranda.</p>

<p>The end.</p>

<p>March 23, 2023. More than one and a half year later, I am here to write this.
I don&rsquo;t even remember anything of what I was going to write.</p>

<p>Today is now Saturday, January the fourth, <strong>2025</strong>!. Yes, 2025.
Can u believe it!?!?! I barely can!</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to Mexico City to get a typewriter (yes, those ancient
beautiful machines) fixed. I could not find any shops
near were I live. The nearest one was in Mexico City.</p>

<p>So I went there. And there it was. A shop. A workshop. Its banner
barely said anything about typewriters.
The business itself is more tailored to the fixing of printing machines,
the newer machines that have become the norm in almost every house with a
computer. You have a computer, you are to print. And if you didn&rsquo;t have
a printer at home you wen&rsquo;t to the stationery store. In Spanish this is
a <em>papelería</em>. And I also had with me another machine which I had been
almost using daily for about two weeks or so now. And that one worked
almost flawlessly. Maybe every 300 characters or so it slightly jammed,
it was easy getting it to work again but it did need some cleaning
which I am not trusting myself to do but more a professional.</p>

<p>I was with my father and we were in awe as a professional artisan took
a look at each and every single one of the compact heavy machines we
brought to him. He inspected them, carefully but firmly pressed
each key as to see what could possibly be wrong, checked some gears,
lever-looking metal things, the roller which rolls the paper after
doing a return-carriage.</p>

<p>I hope for them to be ready in a week or so. We&rsquo;ll see. For now I&rsquo;ll have
to settle writing on my Laptop, a Thinkpad T490. I should name this
beast, should you come up with a suitable name please contact me.</p>

<p>I also spent time with my Father as we visited the downtown of Mexico City,
near the big government buildings like the Mail Office and the Supreme
Court of Justice. We were going to eat in a tavern, a place where you
usually drank some kind of alcohol and they served you the food of the
day, you got another drink, they served you more food, usually the next
course. We were expecting to go to a <em>cantina</em>, <em>canteen</em>, <em>tavern</em>,
<em>bar-looking</em> place but no. To our delight we were greeted with a fancy
restaurant with extremely nice food. Nice waiters and a lot of history
with cloths framed to the walls with fancy signatures, writings,
and drawings of famous people. And my Dad and I talked about
things, not that much but it was a start. A better start than most I&rsquo;d
say. Than most starts I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll
ever have day as beautiful as yesterday. But it was also horrible in
some sense. After we ate, I drove us to a tyre shop to the west of
Mexico City. After we arrived, my nose started to shut down as it
got more and more inflammated (irritated). It got red, it got stuffy,
it was harder and harder to breath, sneeze after sneeze, mucus
after mucus. Paper, more toilet paper, washing hands a lot. Going to the
bathroom a lot as I did not carry any tissue paper with me at the time.</p>

<p>But we also heard some nice tunes I&rsquo;d say on the way to the tyre shop.
I don&rsquo;t remember which specifically. Nah, I&rsquo;m lying. I do remember
some Radiohead in there, and that&rsquo;s really all I remember.</p>

<p>I will now cut to the end and leave you in suspense to show how a great
storyteller I am (out of ideas).</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s that. And hopefully today will be a beautiful day to you to!</p>

<p>Hello! My Mom asked me to archive the pictures and videos on her iPhone.
I tried doing it without iTunes and was somewhat successful!
I was able to keep all of her albums!</p>

<p>One knows that iTunes can be a very buggy piece of software. I&rsquo;ve personally
backed up very few times iPhones using iTunes, as I do not really care
about having the apps backed up. I only care about the Photos and videos.</p>

<p>It should be as easy as connecting it to your computer, right? Well, no.
I mean, kind of. You can easily connect your iPhone to your Windows computer
and from your iPhone click on &lsquo;Trust this device&rsquo; and it will magically open
up the access to your iPhone&rsquo;s DCIM folder which contains all your pictures.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using Garuda Linux but I&rsquo;ve been able to mount my iPhone with Arch Linux:
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/IOS">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/IOS</a></p>

<p>Note: It was a pain in the ass finding the mount point of my iPhone in Garuda
Linux. They really didn&rsquo;t make it easy! Turns out it was in
<code>/run/user/1000/kio-fuse-OUJOte/</code>. I could see the files in the file manager,
but whenever I right clicked to open a terminal, it would drop me in the home
of my root user for some reason.</p>

<p>For those that would like to follow along, the shell I&rsquo;m using is <code>zsh</code>.</p>

<p>The pictures in <code>DCIM/</code> have plenty of metadata in there.
But the albums are nowhere to be found.
I remember looking back a while ago when making a backup of my iPhone
and I couldn&rsquo;t find anything interesting. But today I chose to look further.</p>

<p>And I found an SQLite database! It has a bunch of stuff about Photos. I found
it here: <code>/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite</code>.</p>

<a name="big-big-database"></a>
<h1>big big database</h1>

<p><small>or not so big, idk it was like 350 MB</small></p>

<p>Now, after archiving all the pictures under <code>/DCIM</code> using <code>rsync --archive</code>
I manually wrote down the name of each album and the amount of pictures it had.
I copied the database to my backup and started looking. I started by making
a full dump with <code>sqlite3 Photos.sqlite .dump</code>. And that definitely took a
while because for some reason I decided to read the sqlite file directly from
the iPhone. I definitely should have copied it over to my hard drive first.
Anyways, I started grepping in the dump for the names of the albums and found
that the table <code>ZGENERICALBUM</code> is an album description for all the albums.
It has the <code>Z_PK</code> column, this corresponds to the Album number, then
<code>ZCACHEDCOUNT</code>, which contains the total count of Pictures and Videos in the
Album (the sum of <code>ZCACHEDPHOTOSCOUNT</code> and <code>ZCACHEDVIDEOSCOUNT</code>
should be <code>ZCACHEDCOUNT</code>); the last relevant column is <code>ZTITLE</code> which you
guessed it&hellip; is the title for the album.</p>

<p>I also found another table called <code>Z_28ASSETS</code>. This contains a list of the
files that are in Albums. It took me a while before realizing the meaning
of the fields. I knew the first one was definitely the album number, so
<code>Z_28ALBUMS</code> corresponds to the <code>Z_PK</code> field in the <code>Z_GENERICALBUM</code> table. I
eventually found out that the field <code>Z_3ASSETS</code> translates to the <code>Z_PK</code>
field in the <code>Z_ASSET</code> (yes, &ldquo;not ASSETS&rdquo;) table.</p>

<a name="Reconstructing-the-favorites-album"></a>
<h1>Reconstructing the favorites album</h1>

<p>But first I found out about the favorites album. This album isn&rsquo;t located
in the <code>ZGENERICALBUM</code>. After all, it isn&rsquo;t generic. It&rsquo;s actually located
in the <code>ZASSET</code> table. This is actually where all the pictures and videos
are. There are even fields with the coordinates of the location where your
picture was taken and a ton of other fields from which I don&rsquo;t really understand
their purpose. Anyways, the <code>ZFAVORITE</code> field is in the <code>ZASSET</code> table and
if its value is 1, it&rsquo;s in the favorite album. And there&rsquo;s also a field called
<code>ZDIRECTORY</code> and <code>ZFILENAME</code> and this gives us the exact path to get each
picture or video. So all I had to do to get the favorites album was:</p>

<p><pre><code>sqlite3 Photos.sqlite "SELECT Z_PK,ZDIRECTORY,ZFILENAME FROM ZASSET WHERE ZFAVORITE=1;" &gt; albums.favorites
</code></pre>
We can generate the path with:</p>

<p><pre><code>awk -F '|' '{printf("%s/%s\n", $2, $3)}' &lt; albums.favorites &gt; favorites.unreal
</code></pre>
Now, just to rule out any bad pictures, I&rsquo;ll make sure that they exist by
<code>ls</code>ing them:</p>

<p><pre><code>for x in `cat favorites.unreal`;
do
ls ../$x
z=$?
if [ $z -eq 0 ]; then
echo $x &gt;&gt; favorites.real;
fi
done
</code></pre>
This is my file structure:</p>

<p><pre><code>DCIM/
    XYZAPPLE/
    ...
dev/
    Photos.sqlite
albums/
    ...

working directory: dev/
</code></pre>
In my case, no files were removed from <code>favorites.unreal</code>. Now that we
have the file list in <code>favorites.real</code>, we can make symbolic links
in a folder and make that our favorites album:</p>

<p><pre><code>mkdir -p ../albums/favorites &amp;&amp; for x in $(cat favorites.real); do
ln -s ../../$x ../albums/favorites/${x##*/}
done
</code></pre>
Note: the <code>${x##*/}</code> in zsh means anything that matches <code>*/</code> in <code>$x</code>
you shall remove. This will basically leave the filename only
without the rest of the path (<code>abc/gde/qed</code> -> <code>qed</code>).</p>

<p>Now your favorites folder should be in albums/favorites with all your pictures
and videos.</p>

<p>Note: There may appear slightly more pictures than there actually are on
your iPhone&rsquo;s favorites album,
there may be some kind of &lsquo;picture deleted&rsquo; field that I haven&rsquo;t found yet.</p>

<a name="Reconstructing-the-other-albums"></a>
<h1>Reconstructing the other albums</h1>

<p>This was pretty hard. As I mentioned before, I knew that the first field
<code>Z_28ALBUMS</code> in
the <code>Z_28ASSETS</code> table corresponded to the album number but I was unsure of
the only other two fields:
<code>Z_3ASSETS</code> and <code>Z_FOK_3ASSETS</code>. At first, I thought it was some kind of
permutation between the <code>XYZAPPLE</code> and the file itself but that didn&rsquo;t work
out.
Eventually I was using <code>sqlitebrowser</code> and <code>sqlite3</code> at the same time on
different tables and saw the exact numbers! I figured out that the field
<code>Z_3ASSETS</code>
in the table <code>Z_28ASSETS</code> was the same as the field <code>Z_PK</code> in the <code>ZASSET</code>
table, the latter of which had the filename. Now it was just a matter
of putting everything together.</p>

<p>First, get the albums from sqlite:</p>

<p><pre><code>sqlite3 Photos.sqlite "SELECT Z_PK, ZCACHEDCOUNT, ZTITLE FROM ZGENERICALBUM WHERE ZCACHEDCOUNT&gt;0 and ZTITLE is not null;" &gt; albums.list
</code></pre>
Second, for each album we will create a directory in <code>album/</code> with the name and album number (apparently, Apple allows for two albums to have the same name so the album number Z_PK is added to differentiate between the two)</p>

<p><pre><code>awk -F '|' '{printf("../albums/%06d_%s\n", $1, $3)}' &lt; albums.list | xargs --delimiter "\n" mkdir -p
</code></pre>
Now we will make another set of album folders to save all the <code>Z_3ASSETS</code> fields that match each album number and then for each album, we will iterate over the file list, get the file name from the <code>ZASSET</code> table and add a symbolic link to the album folder:</p>

<p><pre><code>mkdir albums_data

awk -F '|' '{printf("albums_data/%d\n", $1)}' &lt; albums.list | xargs --delimiter "\n" mkdir


for x in $(ls albums_data);
do
sqlite3 Photos.sqlite "SELECT Z_28ALBUMS,Z_3ASSETS,Z_FOK_3ASSETS FROM Z_28ASSETS WHERE Z_28ALBUMS is $x" | awk -F '|' '{ printf("%s\n", $2) }' &gt; albums_data/$x/files;
    for file in $(cat albums_data/$x/files);
    do
    sqlite3 Photos.sqlite "SELECT ZDIRECTORY,ZFILENAME FROM ZASSET WHERE Z_PK is $file" | awk -F '|' '{ printf("%s/%s\n", $1, $2) }' | xargs -I .fname ln -s "../../.fname" ../albums/0*?${x}_*/
    done;
done;

</code></pre>
</p>

<a name="done-21-"></a>
<h1>done!</h1>

<p>If you did everything right, you should have an <code>albums</code> folder with many more
directories inside it!</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how to rule out &lsquo;deleted&rsquo; files, so if you
added a picture to an album and then removed it, it will probably appear.</p>

<p>The end.</p>

<p>.ps: info on the database:</p>

<p><pre><code>TABLE ZASSET contains a lot of columns
column Z_PK         this is the file id
column ZDIRECTORY   this is the location XYZAPPLE/
column ZFILENAME    this is the file name XYZ.{HEIC,JPEG,PNG,MOV}

TABLE Z_28ASSETS contains 3 columns
column Z_28ALBUMS corresponds to the album number to which the file is part of.
column Z_3ASSETS is the identifier that corresponds to the Z_PK field in the Z_ASSET table
column Z_FOK_3ASSETS is something...


TABLE ZGENERICALBUM contains a lot of columns
column Z_PK is the number of the album
column ZCACHEDPHOTOSCOUNT is the photo count of the album
column ZTITLE is the album title

TABLE Z_27ALBUMLISTS idk what's in here
</code></pre>

<p>Today, hello. I am writing slightly uncomfortably
on a moving bus. It looks small from the back. But it&rsquo;s
indeed a relatively large bus. It is the first time I use
one of these tables. There are tables for eight passengers.
Always at the back. Are they eight tables? Or just two?
They seem to be two. Since on each side of the bus there are
four seats, two seats facing another two seats. With a table
in the middle. And then there are these little arm/tablerests on top
of the big table
with hinges attached to it. And they say not to put your
arms over it. But that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s for. Maybe they mean your
full weight or something.</p>

<p>Anyways, apparently there is WiFi. I&rsquo;ve never used the WiFi on this bus.
I like to be out of connection when being on a bus.</p>

<p>Although calls do come in every once in a while. From my parents, mostly.
I haven&rsquo;t written in a big while. My last post must be more than a month old,
I think. Esteban read it, thank you Esteban.</p>

<p>Waht to write about? So many thoughts on my mind. The sound is ever-so
increasingly  loud. Metal banging against plastic, I think. Or maybe metal
against metal and some plastic in there. I just feel like this experience is
weird.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a movie playing on the bus with the (probably main) character being played
by the guy who is in many Wes Anderson movies. With an oval face. There&rsquo;s a guy
with a Macintosh sitting near me. He is in the section with tables. He&rsquo;s on the left
side of the bus. But he&rsquo;s the closest one to the aisle. I&rsquo;m also next to the aisle,
but on the right side of the bus and sitting at the back. He&rsquo;s sitting one seat
before the back.</p>

<p>I think this is the first time in a while that I don&rsquo;t sleep on a bus. It has been
a while. I remembered it quieter. I believe the transmission and motor stuff
are just more audible in the back of the bus than say, the front.</p>

<p>This is a good start. end for now.</p>

<p>Lunes 16 de octubre de 2023.
Acrerca de: El Teatro ó El Teatro y Yo.
Título: aún no decidido.</p>

<p>El Teatro. El Teatro es algo. No es alguien. No es una persona. Podría ser varias ideas. No creo que sea una sola idea. Puede ser muchas cosas, claramente. Puede ser bailar, cantar, actuar. Verse a los ojos en un escenario. O también en la calle. No hay que estar tan alto en un bloque de madera o viendo a lo lejos desde unas butacas incómodas para decir que vivimos el teatro. El teatro es una manera de contar historias. Sí, ya sé. Hay muchas maneras de contar historias. Pero el teatro es más personal. Es en vivo. Hay personas frente a frente. Hay butcas, sillas. Un escenario de madera que a veces rechina. La acción sucede ahí mismo. Y sólo lo presenciarás una vez. Podrás ir a ver una obra del mismo director, mismos actores, mismo todo, una y otra y otra y otra vez. Pero nunca será lo mismo. La hora no será la misma. Probablemente el día tampoco. Los actores idealmente estarán pensando en básicamente nada y sólo serán quien tengan que ser. Porque ser un actor se trata de comprender una escena, se trata de ser quien tienes que ser. Tienes que vivir y sólo ser. Sí, sí estás pensando. Pero estás pensando como todos los días, siendo quien tengas que ser.</p>

<p>El teatro puede ser esto:</p>

<p>Oh, Hanna. How I&rsquo;d like to meet you is&hellip; i don&rsquo;t know. Yeah, I like you, sure. You&rsquo;re beautiful. I&rsquo;ve heard you&rsquo;ve got a boyfriend. Fine, I won&rsquo;t try to ask you out. Yet, I still want to meet you. Wouldn&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t you? I wanna meet you. Know who you are. Know why the fuck do we stare at each other. Maybe we wonder too much about what could be, instead of doing whatever it is we wanna do, you know? I wanna give you a kiss, just for fun. But alright, I won&rsquo;t, I know you&rsquo;ve got a boyfriend so I won&rsquo;t try to do that. But you see, the obsession is not with being your boyfriend. It&rsquo;s with getting to know you. Know what&rsquo;s going on in your mind, understanding how you can achieve such beauty.</p>

<p>I wanna ask you if I, me, myself, ever happens to cross around your mind, If you ever wonder about me, if I create, if any, importance within you.</p>

<p>Fin.</p>

<p>Hopefully it is not a tragedy. I am rebooting my server
after more than 374 days of uptime. Not complete uptime,
since sometimes I do reboot the webserver command (<code>lighttpd</code>)
every once in a while. But in fact, this computer has been alive,
consuming some amount of electricity, power, work from somewhere else,
for the last 6 minutes,
21 hours, nine days, and one full year as of writing this. In a
few minutes time, power will be cutoff for a few seconds, and
then, back to business!</p>

<p>But what is it with computers and rebooting, that we must do it all
the time. It feels kind of essential. We&rsquo;ve built this persistence around
memory, hard disks, solid-state drives. The files will be there, intact,
thanks to the error-correction built-in to file systems and physical
devices. Pretty weird, right? That you can kill all the power, turn on
again and it will work almost exactly the same as before. Or maybe
your error will be fixed, because of some weird condition in the code
that specifically made it act that way.</p>

<p>Oh, computers, persistence is key. But the persistence of the reboot is there.
It has stood time. It is still advisable to reboot your computer. To turn it
on and off and see if it works. Or just for the good of the device, right?
I always turn off my computer when I am not using it. Even if I will use it in
30
minutes, I will turn it off. I&rsquo;ve been told to do that. Some people like my
sister do not. She leaves it on &lsquo;suspend&rsquo;. She just closes the lid and lets
it be. Some other people do to. I&rsquo;ve seen it with my own eyes. Is it bad?
It&rsquo;s their device after all, not mine. Their decision. I am unsure if it&rsquo;s
actually better or worse, I feel the latter.</p>

<p>But you see, this uptime, this little huge number (about 32,390,084 seconds)
has been there, coexisting in time. It&rsquo;s the longest any of my property has
stayed on, as far as a I now. It&rsquo;s the only computer I own that has stayed on
for that long! I even have the uptime advertised on my <em>curriculum vitae</em>.
Yes, my CV! here: <a href="https://cv.thetrevor.tech">https://cv.thetrevor.tech</a>. Actually, the last time the
uptime of my server was recorded was on Agusut the 16th at 10:43:02 CDT 2023.
That was an uptime of a little more than 365 days, almost exactly a year!
Very weird thing to discover. And when I reboot, will it all go to doom?
I sure hope not, since I am not where my server is.</p>

<p>My server is far, far away. Slightly less than 100 miles from me. Should it
not wake back up, what should I do? Well, I&rsquo;ve done this before,
I will not
lie.
I&rsquo;ve talked to people near the server, to see if they can fix it. They have
indeed fixed it. Thank you.</p>

<p>But I want it to spring back to life. On its own. It should connect to the
network automatically, exposing its ports (80 and 443) to the world, not
giving a worry about anything, and really Just Workin'!</p>

<p>I hope you really do work. This will be the last upload with a very big uptime
of 374 days and a little more time.</p>

<p>Alright, see you on the other side!</p>

<p>Alonzo Church nació el 14 de junio de 1903, en Washington, D.C. Su padre fue un juez. Estudió en la Universidad de Princeton y obtuvo una Licenciatura en Matemáticas. Se graduó en 1924 y pasó a obtener un doctorado en los próximos tres años bajo Oswald Veblen.</p>

<p>Fue maestro de filosofía y matemáticas por casi cuarenta años. Dentro de sus trabajos notables, se encuentra su desmostración al problema Entscheidungsproblem, desarrollado independientemente de Alan Turing y en donde llegaron a la misma conclusión. Se destaca por haber inventado el Cálculo Lambda, un sistema de notación para funciones y sus aplicaciones. Church fue el asesor de tesis de Alan Turing, también en la universidad de Princeton.</p>

<a name="L1.-Introducci-c3--b3-n"></a>
<h1>1. Introducción</h1>

<p>El Cálculo Lambda es un Sistema Formal que busca definir una notación para funciones y sus aplicaciones. Fue desarrollado durante el siglo XX.</p>

<p>El Cálculo Lambda pretende definir un modelo que utilice la abstracción pura para definir funciones y aplicar las mismas, definiendo objetos primitivos para poder realizar generalizaciones.</p>

<p>Ha sido la base para muchos lenguajes de programación de tipo funcionales, incluyendo CommonLISP, Scala, entre otros. Asimismo, el concepto de los lenguajes funcionales se deriva, en parte, de las investigaciones de Church y otros matemáticos. Los lenguajes funcionales ofrecen un nuevo paradigma para observar, modelar y diseñar algoritmos.</p>

<p>Esta investigación busca ofrecer una introducción al Cálculo Lambda a través de varias perspectivas, incluyendo un análisis de la Teoría desarrollada por Church, así como los usos dentro de las Ciencias de la Computación, sus diferencias con otros lenguajes de programación y usos dentro de las Matemáticas.</p>

<a name="L2.--c2--bf-Qu-c3--a9--es-una-Funci-c3--b3-n-3f-"></a>
<h1>2. ¿Qué es una Función?</h1>

<p>Una función, también llamada transformación u operación, es una regla de correspondencia por la cual se obtienen valores a través de argumentos. Es decir, le proveemos a una función un argumento (también referido como un valor de entrada<a href="#Referencias">[1]</a>) y obtenemos el valor de la función para ese argumento (también referido como valor de salida<a href="#Referencias">[1]</a>).</p>

<p>Para estas llamadas funciones no necesitamos utilizar todos los posibles valores dentro de los números, sino que podemos definir la existencia de nuestra función sólo bajo cierto rango de valores para los que nuestra función será válida. Cuando la función sea aplicada con un argumento cuyo valor no coincida dentro del rango especificado, se podrá decir que no tiene sentido aplicar la función con ese argumento.</p>

<p>Para el Cálculo Lambda, se utiliza una noción de la aplicabilidad de una función de una manera más abierta. Normalmente, no se permitiría utilizar dentro de una función f como argumento la misma función f. El Cálculo Lambda define teoremas de consistencia que permitirán que esta noción sea válida para este sistema formal (Church, 1941).</p>

<a name="L3.-Abstracci-c3--b3-n"></a>
<h1>3. Abstracción</h1>

<p>La abstracción se refiere a la generalización de problemas para poder obtener soluciones generales a un problema en específico. Estas generalizaciones de problemas se derivan de problemas concretos y después se empiezan a sustituir los objetos concretos por nombres, para así generalizar las instancias de estos objetos concretos, convirtiéndose en instancias generalizadas y obteniendo así soluciones generales.</p>

<p>Ejemplo de un problema concreto:</p>

<p>Ejemplo 1:</p>

<p><em>Considere que quiere comprar 9 productos a 10 pesos cada uno.</em></p>

<p>La fórmula para el costo total es:</p>

<p><img src="assets/calculoLambda.3.1.svg" ></p>

<p>En el Ejemplo 1., se realiza una operación concreta de la multiplicación en los valores concretos 10 y 9. Para obtener una solución general al problema, se abstrae el número de productos y el precio por cada producto.</p>

<p>Ejemplo 2:</p>

<p><em>Considere que quiere comprar 5 productos a 10 pesos cada uno.</em></p>

<p>La fórmula para el costo total es:</p>

<p><img src="assets/calculoLambda.3.2.svg" ></p>

<p>Ahora, se puede utilizar la fórmula del Ejemplo 2. para evaluar un problema con diferentes valores y no se depende en valores específicos para explicar la solución a un problema general.</p>

<p>Se puede decir que la abstracción está completa pero también se puede volver a abstraer de nuevo extrayendo la operación que se realiza a los números, es decir, el signo de multiplicación: *. Se deja como ejercicio al lector el crear una fórmula que permita cambiar de operación (como división, multiplicación, etcétera). Evidentemente, la nueva fórmula respondería a un problema general mayor y no solamente al problema general de obtener el costo total.</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Abstracción se basa en la generalización a través de la introducción de un nombre para reemplazar un valor y especialización a través del reemplazo de un nombre con otro valor.&rdquo; (Michaelson, 1989)</p>

<a name="L4.-Escribiendo-C-c3--a1-lculo-Lambda"></a>
<h1>4. Escribiendo Cálculo Lambda</h1>

<p>Escribir Cálculo Lambda<a href="#Referencias">[2]</a> bajo la sintaxis que Church diseñó permite tener un sistema formal en donde si no coincide con el sintaxis no será un término lambda correcto. Cualquier término que esté sintácticamente correcto será válido en el sistema formal de Cálculo Lambda<a href="#Referencias">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Los símbolos primitivos que se utilizan son:</p>

<p><img src="assets/calculoLambda.4.1.svg" ></p>

<p>Léase como &ldquo;lambda, paréntesis abierto, paréntesis cerrado&rdquo;.</p>

<p>También se utilizan una cantidad de símbolos infinitos llamados variables:</p>

<p><img src="assets/calculoLambda.4.2.svg" ></p>

<p>Se recomienda utilizar las letras del abecedario.</p>

<p>Los términos-λ (léase términos lambda) se definen inductivamente:</p>

<ul>
<li>toda variable es un término-λ válido</li>
<li>término-λ de aplicación: si <em>M</em> y <em>N</em> son términos-λ, entonces también lo es <em>( M N )</em></li>
<li>término-λ de abstracción: si M es un término-λ y <em>z</em> es una variable, entonces <em>( λz[M] )</em> un término-λ</li>
</ul>


<p>(Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2021)</p>

<a name="L8.-Notaci-c3--b3-n-Alternativa"></a>
<h1>8. Notación Alternativa</h1>

<p>Al hacer investigaciones acerca del Cálculo Lambda, se pueden encontrar diferentes notaciones. Church propuso diferentes sintaxis para definir el Cálculo Lambda. Las siguientes expresiones son equivalentes:</p>

<p><img src="assets/calculoLambda.8.1.svg" ></p>

<p>Para estas expresiones, el uso de paréntesis es opcional e incluso al aplicar una función no se necesitan paréntesis en algunos casos pero sí se pueden utilizar para tener una notación más explícita.</p>

<p>Church utilizó corchetes<a href="#Referencias">[3]</a> en artículos anteriores como &ldquo;An Unsolvable Problem of Number Theory&rdquo; (1936) y &ldquo;A Set of Postulates for the Foundation of Logic&rdquo; (1932). Sin embargo, él recalca en &ldquo;The Calculi of Lambda-Conversion&rdquo; (1941) que los corchetes<a href="#Referencias">[3]</a> se pueden reemplazar con puntos, de tal manera que el punto reemplaza directamente al corchete abierto y el corchete cerrado se elimina por completo.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard. Well, maybe not that hard. But when
you coded a half-assed program to generate an RSS
feed using shell scripting inside a makefile it&rsquo;s gonna
be pretty hard to fix it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most likely going to rewrite all the RSS feed generator
in C. I hope that doesn&rsquo;t bring any more problems&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, it all began when one of my readers told me that he
was attempting to use the RSS feed and told me that it was
broken. He didn&rsquo;t explain much else beyond that, aside from
the fact that the atom link was broken too.</p>

<p>And by broken, he meant that it wasn&rsquo;t being properly parsed. But
the atom link just has been broken for a while - because the file
doesn&rsquo;t exist on purpose. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to fix both, the RSS
and the Atom feeds which are very similar but just haven&rsquo;t had
the will to do it, until now apparently. I hope this will lasts
long enough that I am able to fix both problems.</p>

<p>Well, onto the story. So I replied back to him, thinking if I should
even reply. Should I reply right now saying the problem has been
acknowledged and I&rsquo;ll try to fix it or email him when it&rsquo;s fixed !?
I don&rsquo;t know. Well, I replied anyway, saying that the RSS generator
was probably doing something wrong and that caused the parsing in his
RSS feed to not work. I mean, just opening the file in chromium-
a web browser-
yielded a parsing error.</p>

<p>Turns out, the error was in the title of one of my blog posts. It
had two <code>&lt;/em&gt;</code> tags, literally. Notice that <code>&lt;/em&gt;</code> is the closing
tag of <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> but turns out I forgot to write the opening <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
tag in the title. I wanted a part my title to show up in italics
so that&rsquo;s what I thought I wrote in, one <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and then one <code>&lt;/em&gt;</code>
tag. But I wrote just two <code>&lt;/em&gt;</code> instead. So the only
thing I had to do was remove one single slash character <code>/</code>, add
the file to staging through git with <code>git add file</code>, commit and
push to my server. Then wait for the blog to be generated. Because
it&rsquo;s not HTML. It&rsquo;s markdown and it has to be parsed first into html.
Then the RSS feed is generated and so on.</p>

<p>I waited for it to finish, it took a minute and a half or so. Now I
checked again and there it was, without no error in chromium. Showing
the ugly XML file. Then I put in the RSS url into a free RSS viewer
<a href="#references">[0]</a> and it worked! It really worked.</p>

<p>I was very proud of that. To be fair, I only found out about that wrong
<code>&lt;/em</code> because the chromium browser said error parsing at line something
column something. Still, that was fast debugging.</p>

<a name="step-1-of-making-a-better-RSS-feed"></a>
<h1>step 1 of making a better RSS feed</h1>

<p>probably, code in something that removes all html special characters
such as html tags and replaces them with nothing. Or maybe its markdown
equivalent. e.g. replace <code>&lt;em&gt; bla bla &lt;/em&gt;</code> with <code>_ bla bla _</code> and
so on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s easy enough I guess, I&rsquo;ll do it later today maybe. I&rsquo;m still unsure
of what I&rsquo;m going to code or how I should fix the whole RSS feed generator
thing. I&rsquo;m unsure if it should all go into one program. or if I should
outsource some tasks to the makefile that in turn, uses the <code>git</code> command
to get important things such as the date, file name, link, etc. Maybe
I should follow the UNIX way.
<strong>Your program should do the following: Do one thing and do it well</strong>
Maybe I should have several tiny programs that help me and then pipe them
together. I think that sounds nice.</p>

<p>Please share your thoughts!</p>

<p>When do you ever, truly, feel happy ?</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s when your willingness to live to survive, increases.
When you wanna feel alive you wanna just keep on living and you&rsquo;re
so fucking high on adrenaline you just feel like you wanna keep going.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I felt like whilst watching Uncut Gems. A movie with Adam
Sandler. It&rsquo;s about a guy who deals jewelry, all kinds of things.
Fancy, big things. He&rsquo;s jewish.</p>

<p>so he gets this rock. And the guy&rsquo;s a gambler, like a real fucking
gambler. He gambles his money at work. He owes debt to a ton shit
of guys. Even one of his family members. And one of his family even
makes Adam Sandler get beat up cause he stills owes money.</p>

<p>And you know, the plot realy doesn&rsquo;t matter that much. Well, no, it does,
it did to me!</p>

<p>Really, what this film is about. It&rsquo;s about the unexpected. About life
itself, you never really know what you&rsquo;re gonna get. You don&rsquo;t know if
all your dreams are gonna come true no matter how hard you work how hard
you put in the hours. Sometimes, it just doesn&rsquo;t work out. At all.
That&rsquo;s what this movie felt like. And all of a sudden, when you feel like
really everything is fucking falling apart, you get this feeling of salvation.</p>

<p>Someone&rsquo;s coming for you. Someone&rsquo;s giving you back your willingness to
survive, to live, to love, to enjoy. And you take it. And you win.</p>

<p>This movie reminded me of a quote from the show &ldquo;Rick and Morty&rdquo;, Rick says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To live, is to risk it all.<br>
Otherwise you&rsquo;re just an inert<br>
chunk of randomly assembled molecules<br>
drifting wherever the universe<br>
blows you.&rdquo;<br></p></blockquote>

<p>- Rick Sanchez (from the show <em>Rick and Morty</em>)</p>

<p>And you see, I just saw below this quote another quote, an interesting one,
which really resonates with the overall theme of the movie:</p>

<blockquote><p>Money will not make you happy,<br>
and happy will not make you money.</p></blockquote>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know who said it, but someone did.</p>

<p>And really the movie all is about money, or addiction maybe, or even just
obsession over something. This guy just feels like money will solve
everything. In reality, it won&rsquo;t at all solve any of his problems
with his family or friends. It will only solve what is immediately bugging
him, and that is that he&rsquo;s in deep debt with some people in the jewelry
business.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s in some much debt that they keep coming to his family events, to the
school of his kids. They strip him naked and get him locked in his car&rsquo;s
trunk. Very fucked up. And don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the guy is kind of an asshole.
He went out lending money and betting it.</p>

<p>But you see, his bet was right. But the guy who lent the money to him heard
that he was betting all he lent and got the broker to call off the bet.
Just like that.</p>

<p>And it is of course depressing, that even after &lsquo;hard&rsquo; work effort, sometimes
you get nothing. Nothingness.</p>

<p>This movie gave me the real feels. To be on the verge of losing it all and
suddenly gaining it back and winning at life. I feel like if I&rsquo;m not risking
anything at all in life, daily things really, then I&rsquo;m not gaining anything.</p>

<p>You may feel like you&rsquo;re risking your hard work, your sanity when you&rsquo;re
at school and after all you&rsquo;re betting that you&rsquo;ll be super fucking
intelligent and you&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>

<p>But you see my man, my ego is fucking high.
I get all kinds of people, well I don&rsquo;t get them to do this. But my friends
understand that I&rsquo;m smart, I&rsquo;m intelligent.</p>

<p>My college degree, right now I&rsquo;m not doing shit for it. I&rsquo;m barely passing,
I&rsquo;m lazy. Because school right now bores me. I&rsquo;m barely risking anything.
Well, I&rsquo;m risking maybe failing one subject this semester but it&rsquo;s not like
my parent&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t fucking pay the subject again. They can but I&rsquo;m just not
motivated enough.</p>

<p>You see, if I&rsquo;m not motivated properly I don&rsquo;t do things. I want all that
pressure to come down on me. I want to feel like my body&rsquo;s about to explode
if I don&rsquo;t do something. And when I do it, I win. All that pressure comes
off and I get to experience happiness. And everybody&rsquo;s proud of everybody
because in the end it worked.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if in the past we were all lazy or whatever or if we didn&rsquo;t
work hard enough. None of that matters in that moment.
What matters is the now, what you just did and what is happening right at this
very moment and that is in one word, success.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I felt on this movie.</p>

<p>Thanks for your attention.</p>

<p>Escribo aquí, ahora, porque puedo y lo he decidido.
El día de hoy me levanté  alrededor de las 8:25 horas de la mañana.
La noche anterior comí mucho. Salí alrededor de las siete u ocho de la
noche por elotes.
Fui con mis amigos a un estacionamiento con un &lsquo;food truck&rsquo; como se le
conoce en los Estados Unidos de América. En español de México también
le decimos así. No he escuchado la expresión &lsquo;un camión de comida&rsquo;. Así
que así se quedará.
Bueno, el punto es que en este puesto venden elote.
Ni siquiera elote en vaso, esquite o trolelote (al menos no lo vi
anunciado).
No. Sólo elote con un palo. Se le pone queso, mayonesa, salda. De todo.
También vendían un tostielote - justo lo que pedí. Es una bolsa de papas
de tu elección (doritos, tostitos, entre otros) y le ponen, efectivamente,
elote y salsa, queso, todo eso lindo y querido.
Y también vendían panqué y pastel de elote. Yo pedí una rebanada de
pastel de elote.
El panqué sabía casi igual - lo probé de un amigo.
Nos gustó.
Está cerca de donde vivo.
Unos amigos ya habían venido a este lugar y nos invitaron. De hecho nos
fuimos en un sólo coche. Un poco encimados. Bueno, bastante realmente.</p>

<p>De regreso algunos amigos quisieron comprar en un súper así que no estuvo
para nada apretado.
Para hacerles el cuento largo, cuando llegamos jugué ping pong con el amigo
que nos trajo.
Estuvimos retando por una media hora, tal vez una.
Después se fue y llegaron otros amigos que viven cerca.
Decidimos cenar juntos.
Cenamos pollo frito, de KFC.
Lo pedimos a través de Rappi. Salió un tanto, bueno, bastante caro.
Alrededor de $170 pesos mexicanos por persona. ¡Sí, en serio!
Éramos cuatro (4) personas.
Pedimos un combo pero me imagino que rappi o el propio restaurante
infló los precios.</p>

<p>Bueno, también pedimos el modo de envío rápido o &ldquo;prioridad&rdquo; por diez
(10) pesos más. Sí, sólo diez pesos.
Al final tardó una media hora en llegar el pedido. Parece ser que el
repartidor estuvo un ratote esperando el pedido.
Me imagino que en un jueves por la noche estaba bastante ocupado el
restaurante.</p>

<p>Como decía, cené mucho la noche anterior. Me cómí cuatro piezas de pollo.
Muy rico y grasoso. Pollo frito / empanizado.
Un amigo extranjero dice que está mucho más rico el KFC aquí en México
que allá en su país.</p>

<p>Me empecé a bañar esa mañana. Me tardé unos 20 minutos, un poco menos
tal vez y después me tardé algo arreglándome para un taller, clase
de batería - el instrumento musical.
Era mi primera clase. Llegué unos cinco minutos tarde.
Me presenté con el profesor.
Me gustó la clase.
Es una clase individual.
Nunca he tenido una clase individual de música.
Practicamos ritmos.
No me acuerdo de lo que me enseñó una vez mi querido amigos.
Sin embargo, recuerdo que me divertí mucho.</p>

<p>Después me encontré a un amigo. Desayunamos juntos. No había
tenido tiempo de desayunar antes de mi clase. Hicimos una tarea juntos,
nos tomó un buen rato.
Estaba exhausto. Decidí ir a mi apartamento. Estuve en mi
celular una gran parte. Fui al baño. Tomé agua. Tenía hambre
pero no sabía dónde comer. Decididí ir a una tienda de instrumentos
musicales a comprar unas baquetas. Pensé que me costarían mucho más dinero.
Después fui a comer tres tacos mixiote en un lugar cercano de la tienda.</p>

<p>Empecé a merodear y caminar por doquier. Encontré un parque.
Encontré un segundo parque.
Este segundo parque está raro. Me recordó a alguien, una mujer. El parque
está lleno de Ninfas. Son criaturas mitológicas en forma de mujeres jóvenes
desnudas en medio de paisajes luminosos. Esto según un diccionario. Les
cuento esta historia desde este mismo parque. Hay muchas esculturas de mujeres
desnudas.
Son de algún metal. Hay una como si quisiera alcanzar el sol, las estrellas,
como si estuviera pecando, a punto de agarrar la manzana de un árbol.
La estatua está directamente bajo un árbol, estirándose.</p>

<p>No lo sé, las mujeres son raras. Son hermosas y complejas a la vez.
Pueden ser inteligentes, son humanas después de todo.
Tal vez le debería de hablar a esa mujer, ¿no?. Muchas culturas actuales
tienen problemas para hablar con mujeres atractivas, incluido yo.
Especialmente los hombres.
A veces lo vemos como un trofeo.
Yo intento sentirlo como una experiencia para conocer a una nueva persona,
escuchar sus historias, compartir las mías y transmitir conocimiento.
Son muy diferentes a los hombres. Cuando yo conozco a una mujer,
mi corazón , mi mente se llenan de muchas cosas, sentimientos primitivos
tal vez, de atracción sentimental, a veces sexual. Pero no sé.
Las mujeres me hacen reflexionar de mi vida.</p>

<p>Todavía no sé todo lo que quiero decir con esto de las mujeres.
Tal vez me esté enamorando de una. Nunca sabré con certeza todo lo que
quiero decir, pues nuestra mente pasa por tantos pensamientos a la vez
que se van perdiendo y olvidando inconscientemente. Incluso algunas veces,
al estar transcribiendo mis escritos, me doy cuenta que mi entendimiento
de lo que alguna vez escribí en el pasado también se puede olvidar.
Mi letra va cambiando y con eso mi significado, a veces no descifro
palabras que escribí.</p>

<p>Fin.</p>

<p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>What am i doing here? what am i doing now ?
i do not really know. i can tell that i am writing.
i am writing on a text editor, on vim, on an operating
system called linux.</p>

<p>but how do i feel? because for some reason i keep thinking
and thinking and thinking. but sometimes none of that thinking
sticks.</p>

<p>i think too much. i am a person with ideas that flow. i am
not directing those ideas anywhere, really. why don&rsquo;t i?</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t know, i am unsure. i am writing to remind myself that
i used to do this, write. I used to write on my blog.</p>

<p>maybe someone will read it, maybe someone will not. i also
want to remind myself this blod, it is a record of some
of my thoughts and should act as an archive of my mind.
of the structure of it. or maybe not at all. some articles
are highly edited, some are just written as i&rsquo;m thinking
about them. varies by a lot.</p>

<p>anyways, there&rsquo;s some people i&rsquo;ve met. in these short
two weeks i&rsquo;ve met tons of people. maybe my expectations were too
high and i expected people with too much of me, with too much
of my breed.</p>

<p>but i&rsquo;ve learned that there&rsquo;s variety. i&rsquo;ve met people. hopefully
someone reads this and finds meaning in some of the thoughts
said herein (is this the right fancy way to use this word?).</p>

<p>I dropped out of university. I was majoring for CS Engineering (Ingeniería en Tecnologías Computacionales) at Tec de Monterrey Campus Toluca.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t like it there. I mean, I did but I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t learning. Plus, I was there for three years during high school. Not exactly the same building, but the same place. This might sound kind of dumb, but I wasn&rsquo;t learning much from my programming classes. And my engineering classes could have been better. I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t grasping
the concepts necessary to understand physics, I felt like I was rushing.</p>

<p>I felt like I needed a change.</p>

<p>So I dropped out of there and I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m going to Puebla. It&rsquo;s a three and a half hour drive from where I currently live. I will be studying at UDLAP. that&rsquo;s short for Universidad de las Américas Puebla.
I will be studying the same thing. Here it is called Ingeniería en Sistemas Computacionales.
Or Computer Science Engineering, I think.</p>

<p>Anyways, I will be starting classes on January 9th, 2023. I&rsquo;ll be staying at the university&rsquo;s dorms.</p>

<p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>You know, there was a big gap of history and life between this post and the post
before it: <em>Not on the melancholy hill</em>. I guess I could say that I honestly
felt like shit between those two times but I don&rsquo;t really feel like doing
that.
What i feel like doing is telling a story.
A story of now, of a recent now. Not a yesterday but of today. Of what
I did for me and for others the day of today. That&rsquo;s right, not the morrow
(yes it&rsquo;s an actual word look it up),
not the yesterday but today. What happened today and maybe what will
and what  i want to happen.</p>

<a name="a-new-beginning"></a>
<h1>a new beginning</h1>

<p><small>(not-so)</small>
So yeah, a not so new beginning. I had three alarms set for today.
One at exactly 06:59, another one at 07:00, another one at 07:01. That was it.
This was the day I was actually going to shower fucking early, have the time
of my life and get to my exam on time and maybe study and chat with my
friends. But you know what ? You know what ? Laziness got me!</p>

<p>Damn laziness got me !!! I didn&rsquo;t get up. I kept looking at the time. Ok, 07:01.
Should I get up now ? Nah, it&rsquo;s too early! Let&rsquo;s keep sleeping ! Eventually,
my mom said hello and told me to get up. I tried,
I hugged her. I kinda got up. Then I fell asleep. Again. and Again and again.</p>

<p>I tried getting up. I looked at my phone constantly. I was sleepy but I was
waking up at approximate intervals of five minutes and looked at my phone and
said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too eary to get up and shower, let&rsquo;s sleep more.&rdquo;. Until I kinda
overslept and I showered at 08:00. I was supposed to be eating and making
breakfast by 08:00. A little embarassing for myself.
But then I relaxed because what&rsquo;s the worst that would happen ? That i&rsquo;d
arrive late to school ? Wow, what a naughty irresponsible boy who misses
class and arrives late late late! what a bad boy !</p>

<p>Well yeah, call me an ass or whatever. Sometimes that&rsquo;s me. And that day it
was. My sister was also hoping to get early but at the end we both did things
that made us late and we don&rsquo;t blame each other really, it just happens.
Constantly kinda which is bad and we should work on it. But hey that&rsquo;s life.
Anyways, I got to breakfast. I was already pretty late. I exited the bathroom
and it was like 08:25. So I tried to dry the water off my head with the towel.
I don&rsquo;t like hair dryers. They make too much noise. It boggles me. maybe
there&rsquo;s a better translation for the Spanish word <em>aturdir</em>.
So I put on some clothes, tried to make it fast. Tried to gather all my shit.
Then headed down to the kitchen. It was late indeed so I thought of an easy
breakfast. That took me like two minutes probably. Just to <em>think</em> of it for
some reason.</p>

<p>So  i decided to make a peanut butter jelly sandwich. Peanut Butter. Jelly.
Bread. PBJ Sandiwch. PJ Sandwich. that&rsquo;s it. That was it. I also ate an apple.
A whole apple. While the bread was toasting I thought of going to my bathroom
to wash my teeth because I sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t going to finish that sandwich
at my home.</p>

<p>So I went off to wash my teeth. Then I headed down and got to work on my
sandwich. I had a bread lid and a normal bread thingy. I thought about
what to put on each. Since it would be peanut butter and jelly. I do one
side for each. But the lid has much less surface area. Or at least less
apparent surface area. And it is curved. I thought of putting more
peanut butter jelly so i went for the normal bread slice and then put the
jelly on the bread lid. Then I smashed them together and tadaaa we have
a fucking peanut butter jelly sandwich, right!?</p>

<p>Ok yeah let&rsquo;s go!
And off I went with my sister! She drove. I wanted her to drive because
I just wasn&rsquo;t feeling like driving. I feel like I drive bad sometimes and
this was just a signal to not drive today I guess.</p>

<p>And my sister asked me to read something for her. Some bullshit reading
about hacktivism in Mexico ? I barely read a page and the abstract. It
was fine but too scientifically journalistic for me. Cut the bullshit,
get to the chase.</p>

<p>Stop trying to re-define terms and actually say something of importance.
No one wants to read a distilled shit-tasting article without any
written substance. It&rsquo;s gotta tell a story! Everything has to tell a
story! This was storyless. Technical reading, storyless. Not so interesting.</p>

<p>yet it still intrigued me so I sent it to my phone since I was reading from
my sister&rsquo;s phone. Then we arrived. My sister had to get to class - I did
to but who cares - so I took the car and parked it all the way to disney
(that&rsquo;s what we
call the far end of the parking lot).
And then I got to class.</p>

<p>We worked on modelling projectile motion from rocks that are launched from a
volcano with variable angle and air density and velocity of course! And it
worked pretty nicely, I understood the formulas. I am proud of that code.</p>

<p>And we ordered it with functions and shit and used one single for loop and
structured everything so that we don&rsquo;t forget what the actual fuck the
code does and yes. I am proud of doing that with my friends.</p>

<p>We had some hiccups here and there but our teacher came to the rescue and
our mistake was that we were trying to access a vector value where there
wasn&rsquo;t even a vector and for some reason the matlab interpreter doesn&rsquo;t give
a fuck and just errors out once it sees it! Another bad thing about
non-compiled languages -  I think.</p>

<p>After that I had a bite of my sandwich. Then I went to the bathroom
because I wanted to poop real bad. And of course the bathrooms are full of
shit, they either smell like shit or they work like shit! I really wish
that no one made automatic bathrooms ! Really, it doesn&rsquo;t do any good.</p>

<p>The sensors aren&rsquo;t well made or well calibrated. I constantly get bathrooms
that are always flushing when I sit down. I physically have to touch and leave
my palm on the sensor for it to stop. That&rsquo;s really annoying. And then
how am I supposed to clean myself while doing that ? The position that I&rsquo;m in
is very uncomfortable with one arm twisted in opposite direction of where I&rsquo;m
looking and another hand to clean ? That&rsquo;s bad, very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And then I kinda get shame. Because some guys make fun of people because
the bathroom just keeps flushing ! It really does ! I&rsquo;m not making a prank,
I&rsquo;m not filling the toilet up with toilet paper and making it flood. No,
I&rsquo;m actually using a bathroom for what it was meant to be but not it has
to be me who gets the always-flushing-bathrooms (trademark pending!)!!!</p>

<p>AAAhhh. anyways, this takes a while. maybe 10 minutes. Then I head back to
class. Technically the same class but this class is over because the first two
hours it&rsquo;s with one teacher and the next two is with another one. With this
other teacher we&rsquo;re having a physics exam!! Ahhh, for some reason
people say i&rsquo;m his favorite but i&rsquo;m ashamed because I barely get any knowledge
from the class. I don&rsquo;t understand. Some people say it&rsquo;s the teacher. some
days i am inspired to take in knowledge and i keep making questions and i get
the answers right but others like today like in this exam i was unable
to answer my own questions. And even though I asked the teacher I still
wouldn&rsquo;t get it. I mean, after all it&rsquo;s my mind who has to get it.
Right ? Who on earth has to get this knowledge more than anyone in order
to get a passing grade on the subject ? Well, me, of course.</p>

<p>So it didn&rsquo;t really go well in the exam, alright ?</p>

<p>Yeah, the end.
Oh no wait I&rsquo;m gonna tell more because why not.</p>

<p>So I turned in the exam. Only three questions. But it was digital, so I
couldn&rsquo;t go back to see or choose my previous answer or question.</p>

<p>I had to do one by one. I was getting tired and I kinda re-did each
question twice but still wouldn&rsquo;t get the answer. It was multiple-choice
and my answer wasn&rsquo;t there! So I just kept on going to the next one.
Did i say it was only three questions ? That&rsquo;s too little i guess.
Or too much. Don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Anyways, the class isn&rsquo;t even over but I turn it in like 35 minutes early.
We had like two hours to turn it in. I didn&rsquo;t want to fuck with my mind.
If i don&rsquo;t know something, I don&rsquo;t know it so I acknowledge it. I&rsquo;m not goning
to keep on fucking with my mind and drilling into it until I get an answer I
don&rsquo;t understand. I&rsquo;m not gonna do that. At least not today.</p>

<p>So I give up i turn it in 35 minutes early and I finish that peanut butter
jelly sandwich because really I only had like four bytes max. I go into
the sun I sit on a weird-angled bench and i finish eating it. I&rsquo;m about to
smear my face mask with some jelly so I put the mask aside so that  I don&rsquo;t
dirty it up.  I finish eating. I like what I&rsquo;m eating. I like the sun.
I enjoy the sun. Then I go to walk around. Then I try doing some exercises
but I don&rsquo;t really get these exercises that are on a web platform and the
explanation is pretty bad. Later in the day one question will be solved with
the help of a good friend who actually explained to me what the fuck
was going on ? or maybe i made too many quesitons idk but thanks for helping
me, Alice. Anyways, I try to continue on but actually I have like 70 emails
in my student email inbox so I try clearing them. Most of them is spam of
international programs, events that I don&rsquo;t really care about. They literally
re-send the shit just not giving a shit. It&rsquo;s practically spam. Oh yeah and
did I mention those were just like in three days ? Three days of OFFICIAL
spam email. So fucking annoying.</p>

<p>Anyways I finish up. Now I go to eat. It&rsquo;s 14:00 by now. that&rsquo;s two o'clock.
I go to the cafeteria. To eat well, because I should eat well. And I have
class at 15:00 (three o'clock). And I find a friend. Actually, two friends.
i salute each. I eat with one of them. can you guess who ? I meet some people.
i forgot their names.  i don&rsquo;t know why.</p>

<p>anyways, I try to talk to them, socialize. I try, I try. I kinda succeed. I
don&rsquo;t feel bad about myself so that&rsquo;s good.
Then i finish eating. shit i was supposed to give office hours to a guy
about programming. to tutor him basically because I don&rsquo;t have an official
course this guy is taking or something. I&rsquo;m not a paid teacher but I know
programming and he was looking to get some explanation to a problem.
But i was still eating. the situation was unfortunate. We didn&rsquo;t even meet.
it was too late. i was kinda late for my class. I could have taken longer
and met with the guy because my class always starts late but for some reason
i wanted to get there early. Anyways, we reschedule. Hopefully no one dies.</p>

<p>And so my class at 15:00 begins. Boring, boring boring. Videos about cells.
Sleep. Kinda wake up. Rocking my neck up and down. Rocking it fast up because
I wake up. I cannot find a stable position on which to sleep. That is
annoying. The teacher calls my name. Not me but she says my name but wait it
is actually me. Am i supposed to wake up ? I&rsquo;m sleeping I think she&rsquo;s looking
at me. Oh shit i&rsquo;m awake now. awkward thinking.</p>

<p>anyways she still keeps talking. goes on with the class. class ends. ta-da.
i go to walk. i meet with some friends. I talk a little more. now this is were
a friend helps me with the homework and tells me to meet them somewhere because
right now i&rsquo;m with other friends. so i say goodbye and i go to look for the
friend who&rsquo;s helping me out with this assignment and i take a while, really.
i couldn&rsquo;t find her until i did, i guess. right ?</p>

<p>anyways, she tutors me, we talk a little here and there about life. enjoyable.
then she leaves, i stay trying to solve the next question but i get stuck. i
kinda give up. I send an email to my teacher asking for some office hours and
asking for him for an extension of the assignment. He does not respond. then
i call my sister. My sister is in the car. I want to leave. but she&rsquo;s on-campus
and she&rsquo;s moving the car closer. So i tell her not to leave the car so that
the
engine keeps running but she does in fact turn off the engine because why not
i guess ? then she starts looking for some stuff in the passenger seat. She
takes a while. I want to leave. I&rsquo;m awkwardly standing there. She eventually
finds whatever she&rsquo;s looking for and I leave. We say goodbye.</p>

<p>We shall meet again, sibling.</p>

<p>And then I get home and I drink some water. I was going to watch netflix
but lo and behold my teacher has spoken. he can do office hours now. that
was 10 minutes ago that email was received. I suppose i can still make it.
ok, i set up the virtual meeting and off we go. he does in fact connect like
five minutes after i send out the email (probably less) and well that was
pretty fast. he clears up some doubts well i think i cleared them on
as i was saying them. I guess so ? Maybe he felt bad of not explaining full-on
to me. maybe. maybe not. as i was saying the doubts they cleared up in my head
so that was good.  and then cool . finish. finish meeting. finish meet.
finish exercises. finish more exercises. continue exercises. why isn&rsquo;t this
working. meet mom. mom arrived. talk to mom whilst doing exercises. pay some
attention to mom. talk to mom. go back to exercises. keep talking to mom
while doing some exercises. and maybe i&rsquo;ve written too much.</p>

<p>good bye.</p>

<p>the end.</p>

<p>and well not really hahah.</p>

<p>After that my mom realized that i was kinda busy so she told me ok finish up
there with your exercises you seem like a responsible person for this single
instance of time so why not let you be right now. so i finish up on those
exercises. i feel good about myself. I start watching youtube. i find an
interesting video on calculus. kinda boring the last quarter but hey i
expected something different not that bad eh. then i think of writing
this and hopefully i finish writing this &lsquo;today&rsquo; blog post and i publish
it. the end;</p>

<p>For some strange fucking reason, I feel satisfied.
I am not sad.
I feel like I&rsquo;ve done enough of a purpose to myself and society and to my family. At least for today.
I&rsquo;ve talked to friends, maybe not as much as I like but whatever.</p>

<p>Today I drove. A lot. I drove in highways, strange fucking race-car-like roads that are technically in the state where I live !</p>

<p>I liked driving.
I went to one of my dad&rsquo;s friends from work apartment with my mom and dad, we were invited to a dinner.
He lives in some kind of a paradise.
There&rsquo;s a supermarket in his gated community ! It&rsquo;s gigantic ! There&rsquo;s so many houses surrounded  by the woods. Looks like a lotta rich people live there.</p>

<p>Not necessarily high-class rich people but middle-high class who still work but do a pretty nice living.
Guy&rsquo;s living the dream.</p>

<p>I mean, this guy lives in an apartment.
It&rsquo;s a nice living I suppose.
there are many people with houses there so I suppose
he&rsquo;s technically one of the &lsquo;poor&rsquo;
from there but he sure seems to be making
shit-loads of money. good for him!</p>

<p>anyways, i think I&rsquo;m making this too much about him.
and this is about me. i felt satisfied because, well&hellip; maybe because
I drove
or maybe because I did homework.</p>

<p>Or maybe cause I talked to a good friend
whom I&rsquo;ve known for not so much time but still provides
great influence over intellectual
curiosity and over
my mind.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. what, is this an essay?
am i supposed to end formally
if i am to be a professional writer ?
hmmm, that&rsquo;ll be a question for
another day to answer&hellip;.
or maybe you could
answer it and tell me how i
should live my life.</p>

<p>Hello Stranger. I am me. And i&rsquo;m blogging.</p>

<p>I feel kinda bad, ok ?</p>

<p>Should I ? I don&rsquo;t know.
I enjoyed all this.
The human mind works in very mysterious ways&hellip;
<strong>insert another lame cliché here</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to feel.
i don&rsquo;t know what to think.
The only thing that I know for certain is that I&rsquo;ve balanced
my wrong-doings.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday I lied. I gave into a lie.
But I&rsquo;m an honest person, yet I had the choice to not choose
to lie.
But I fucking did!!
And I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s the other person&rsquo;s fault for suggesting
<em>to lie</em> but in fact, it was my fault.
Cause it&rsquo;s my life, my part in the lie!, am I right ?</p>

<p>Well yeah, of course I&rsquo;m right and if I&rsquo;m not say it to me by whichever
means you consider, ok ?</p>

<p>Now, today I think I&rsquo;ve redeemed myself by not lying and by doing
the exact opposite of what happened if I lied.</p>

<p>And I feel good about it.</p>

<p>At least I know that, so let&rsquo;s not forget that, alright ?</p>

<p>I like falling in love. It was a nice experience.
I would do it again, many many times.</p>

<p><em>J'ai vu et ecouté a ce chanson originale par Pomplamoose <a href="#references">[0]</a>.</em>
<em>Vue les lyrics <a href="#lyrics">ici</a>.</em></p>

<p>Ok, donc qu'est-ce que je pourrait dire ?</p>

<p>Bon, je sais pas. Je pense que ça c'est une chanson pas dépriment nécessairement
mais réaliste de la realité où on vivre. Elle pourrait être la femme ou l'homme
mais à fin on a toujours une personne qui veut d'attention et une personne qui
est occupé déjà avec de travail ou quelques autres choses.</p>

<p>La personne qui chante a beaucoup d'intérêt d'être avec la personne mais
l'autre personne n'a pas l'intérêt. Il est pas interessé plus de être
avec la personne. Il est consummé par plus des choses comme le travail.</p>

<p>Mais la personne - l'homme qui travaile - est dans la date, non ? Il
est physiquement avec cette femme mais pour quoi est-ce qu'il ne prenne pas
d'intérêt s'il est là dejà.</p>

<p>Je sais pas.
Et aussi, analyser une chanson dans ma troisième langue est très difficile,
peut-être je pourrait faire une analysis très loin et plus developpé dans
la langue espagnole ou l'anglais.</p>

<p>Mais le point est que j'aime la chanson et je pense que tu pourrait l'écouter
pour voir s'elle t'a interessé.</p>

<p><em>See also: <strong>Song</strong> Love and happiness <a href="#references">[0]</a> by Al green</em></p>

<p><img src=alice.jpeg ></p>

<p>Love and happiness are weird concepts.</p>

<p>whatis love ? and why does our society take such pride and emotion
into having it ? I mean, not just society, but my family and me as a
whole, right ? Why don&rsquo;t I get the love I deserve ? Maybe I do, but
I just don&rsquo;t see it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried having love, sharing intimacy with others. But I guess I&rsquo;m
just not good enough, or just not good enough for them. Or i haven&rsquo;t
found the right person at all.</p>

<p>But the point of this blog post is to say that maybe, mayybeee
I have the one. Maybe I do. I&rsquo;ve crossed eyes with her. A lot.. maybe
way too much. She&rsquo;s crossed eyes with me. We&rsquo;ve crossed eyes.
Who started it ? Did I ? Hmmm, maybe maybe not ? You see, on a
purely survivalist standard being with that person would most likely
yield me success, even if I don&rsquo;t lvoe her, because it&rsquo;s come to
my knowledge that she is, in fact, the daughter of people
who work in the softwaredev/cybersec sector. So does that mean
potential success ! Well, of course it does. But also, I&rsquo;d like to get
to know her better.</p>

<p>Because why not, right? Honestly, she seems attractive from afar.
Afar, say 6, 8, maybe 10 feet. In the same room, with the voice.
With the authority of her voice.</p>

<p>I wonder if she&rsquo;s read my blog. I don&rsquo;t know if she has. I didn&rsquo;t
advertise when presenting myself. But maybe she found it through
instagram, since my profile is public and there&rsquo;s a link to my blog
and stuff. But she could have also found out thru other means,
such as other people, friends, or even the school platform we
use. I edited my profile and people can click on my profile
and they can see a link for my blog. Maybe she did click on it
and was interested in what I wrote. If so, please tell me.</p>

<p>Anyways, what is the point ? These past two days have been rather
unorthodox. I think I&rsquo;ve been preparing my mind for deep,
extremeley overwhelming tragedy.</p>

<p>you see, I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s nice, ya know ? to live with a human
whose mind is fucking goingn nuts. Knowing that the voice you once heard
is lost. The fights you maybe had, the shit you shared, the shit
you didn&rsquo;t. All those feeling, and those actions are kinda lost. But still
there and omsetimes, every once in a while come back from that brain
and expose themselves. And you feel this
ecstacy crawling through your neck and making your muscles contract
and be an do so many things but then you..</p>

<p><strong>snap back to reality</strong> oh there goes gravity. And you realize the person
you&rsquo;re living with has dementia and just knows that you&rsquo;re married.
At least that&rsquo;s the perspective I get with the alzheimer&rsquo;s and dementia my
grandma&rsquo;s having. And of course, there&rsquo;s my dad. Who is also trying to cope
with this new fucked-up reality by making his family try to help her. Which
I do not think is bad, but after all, we are indeed making her ( my grandma)
a puppet, wouldn&rsquo;t ya agree ?!</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m tired. I barely slept anything today. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p>

<p>And I have kinda a shit-ton of homework and I kinda need to get it done in like
less than 50 minutes.</p>

<p>Bye, let&rsquo;s push this to git.</p>

<p>Instead of working I have found myself dealing
with some mysery and happiness.
Lots of both sometimes.
I miss things.
I think I miss writing.
I like writing at the two a.m. in the morning because why not.</p>

<p>Anyways, I recently bought myself something that actually uses the usb-c
port on my computer. The USB-C connection actually has a Thunderbolt 3
controller and yes, in theory, I could just connect literally everything
I&rsquo;d possibly ever need through that cable.</p>

<p>I went to a Best Buy in Michigan to get a thunderbolt 3 capable dock
but to my surprise I did not find any of my liking. The thing that was
missing the most was a Display Port. Literally none of them had it.
Not even the extra expensive ones. I mean, they were all kinda equally
expensive, even though they&rsquo;re probably as shitty as one would expect
from too new technologies and not enough real manufacturing of them.</p>

<p>In the past month I stumbled upon a hacker news post talking about
thunderbolt 3 was.
The conclusion was that the expensive and ali-express bought docks
were just as equally likely to fail, not work at all, and or work
at advertised speeds.</p>

<p>Anyways, I did find some interesting stuff at the best buy. I found a
micro-SD card reader that has both a USB type A (that&rsquo;s the regular
USB port you&rsquo;re used to) and a USB type C port. That&rsquo;s nice,
maybe I&rsquo;ll gift it to my sister who both owns a regular laptop without
USB type C and an iPad with a USB type C connector, hopefully this will
work if she has to transfer files faster.</p>

<p>So I did buy that, I bought it <em>open box</em> <a href="#references">[0]</a>!
I know, I&rsquo;m a cheap, ain&rsquo;t I ?
Also, I bought a 100-watt USB-C power adaptor for my computer, to charge
it much, much faster. As a bonus, it has a 20-watt <a href="#references">[1]</a>
type-c port and a usb type-a with a little more amperage than your
regular phone brick.</p>

<p>Anyways, I bought these two products. The power adaptor worked great.
I can now fast-charge off a single AC connection three devices at the
same time! Pretty neat. We&rsquo;ll see how hot she gets.</p>

<p>The micro-SD card reader did not work.
Well, the USB type-A connector did work. So that&rsquo;s good. I could access
the file system off my only not-lost micro-SD card and can play
the files just as well as I would on my computer&rsquo;s port.
But the type-C connection wouldn&rsquo;t work.
One of my first ideas was to try on a proprietary operating system
that normies call Windows.
(un?)Fortunately, same results. Only type-A would work.
Although something interesting was that power would indeed work.
I could charge my phone off the port easily. But I could not read
any data off any devices.</p>

<p>So I thought maybe BIOS drivers but wtf am  ieven saying idk. Idk
enough to know if the BIOS is in charge of this or not. Maybe Lenovo
weird firmware updates ?! I checked but nothing. Just annoying windows 10
fat updates. Some Linux stackoverflow questions pointed in weird directions.</p>

<a name="the-culprit"></a>
<h1>the culprit</h1>

<p>the culprit
is that&hellip;
well&hellip; not-so-long ago I delved into my BIOS settings and chose to disable
the THunderbolt 3 port.
To my surprise, power was not cut-off the port and still worked like a
charger and I therefore expected it to still be working.
But in fact I just jumped into my BIOS a few minutes ago and lo and behold
there it was the Thunderbolt 3 disable setting!
turned it right back up, worked like a charm.
Even if the connection
was not over thunderbolt 3, it encapsulates the type-C data port as well,
so that&rsquo;s that. Now I can access my micro-sd through an adapter connected
to a USB-C port that is accessed by a mostly open-source operating system.</p>

<p>nice.</p>

<a name="references"></a>
<h2>references</h2>

<ul>
<li>[0] &ldquo;<em>open box</em>&rdquo;. - I&rsquo;ve never heard of this term
until a friend of mine who lives in the United States told me.
It means that a human presumably opened a product but did not use it.
Then this human returned the product and it is advertised on the price tags
with a discount and a label that says &ldquo;open box&rdquo;. I bought this thingy for like
15 bucks (no tax), like 10 off. Has worked well enough so far.</li>
<li>[1]
fast-charging baby!
which only my dad will get to use because i have an iPhone 6s which fits my
needs. I&rsquo;d love to jailbreak it. Or maybe not ?
Every time I think of doing it I don&rsquo;t have the correct iOS version for it
to work and I kinda don&rsquo;t want to possibly install  malware onto my phone.
WHy am I playing the devil&rsquo;s advocate - and not - every time I think of this ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, <strong>who am I?</strong></p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a great question. I don&rsquo;t really know myself.</p>

<p>If you know french, here is a reflexion essay I made in highschool for my
philosophy course:
<a href="https://files.thetrevor.tech/trevor/misc/qui-suis-je-philos.pdf">https://files.thetrevor.tech/trevor/misc/qui-suis-je-philos.pdf</a></p>

<p>I wanted to start off by explaining the <code>whoami</code> Linux (gnu coreutils) command first. But I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s self explanatory. Computer systems have users. The command just prints who is the user running the command.</p>

<p>But well&hellip; who am I ? That&rsquo;s one of
philosophy&rsquo;s most-searched questions.</p>

<p>So, linux and other operating systems use files.
You might have heard the expression
<em>&ldquo;On Linux, everything is a file.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>And Linux uses lots of files. And if everyone
had the same rights to all files, it&rsquo;d be a mess.
Unprivileged users would be able to edit critical system files.</p>

<p><em>small detour:</em></p>

<p>So, in conclusion folks, applying personifying traits and giving &lsquo;rights&rsquo;
to computer programs to do whatever they want <strong>will</strong> create trouble!
I&rsquo;m talking to you, Github! No reason at all to change from <em>master</em>
to <em>main</em>. Completely absurd.</p>

<p><em>detour ends here</em></p>

<p>So the <code>ext4</code> filesystem has permission on files. I can get the permission
of a file using the <code>ls</code> command with some fancy options:</p>

<p><pre><code># -l stands for long options
$ ls -l articles/whatis-umask.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 john cena 780 May  2 21:03 articles/whatis-umask.md
</code></pre>
where <code>john</code> is the owner of the file and <code>cena</code> is the group owner
of the file. and the first characters are what matter: <code>-rw-r--r--</code>
that garbougle of characters is weird! let&rsquo;s put some spaces!</p>

<p><code>-rw- r-- r--</code>. Okay, looks better. These permissions are for the
user, group, and other, respectively. Yes, <code>john</code> and <code>cena</code> come
into play. <code>john</code> will have <code>-rw-</code>, <code>cena</code> will have <code>r--</code>, and
other will have <code>r--</code>. <code>rw</code> means read, write. <code>r--</code> means
read. <code>rwx</code> means read, write, execute. Yes, execute as in execute
programs.</p>

<p>But cool thing is if it&rsquo;s a directory the <code>x</code> means you can create
files within the directory ! Try it out in a temp folder ! try making
a new dir, looking at file permissions of a folder with <code>ls -lad folder/</code>
and <code>chmod -x</code>ing it. can you create files ? folders ? what happens
if you revert the <code>-x</code> ?</p>

<a name="what-umask-actually-is"></a>
<h1>what umask actually is</h1>

<p>the umask command returns the <strong>inverse</strong> file mask used to create
new files within the current shell. Yes, <strong>INVERSE</strong>. not the &lsquo;real&rsquo;
mask you get with the <code>ls</code> command.</p>

<p><strong>EVEN more confusingly</strong>, you can run the <code>umask -S</code>
command to get a set of friendly-looking
permissions
like in the <code>ls</code> command which will now return the <strong>real file mask</strong>,
not the inverse. You can set the real permissions for your current
shell in the same way by just typing out the permissions you want.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<p><pre><code>umask -S u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx
</code></pre>
</p>

<p><small>but one without headphones
</small></p>

<p>Technically, I did get earphones.
But I just got a kinda severe ear infection from which I am just recovering and it has been a wild ride.</p>

<p>One of my ears used to be plugged but I didn&rsquo;t do much about it until it started to hurt.
I went to a party and then left early because one of my ears was practically burning, or at least that&rsquo;s what it felt like.
Next day I went to the doctor and he told me that I had an ear infection. But this doctor showed me what was inside my ear.
And in the other one too. The difference was clear.
The ear conduct in the bad ear was very small and red, there were little pimples inside it which were just inflammation. It certainly hurt. Plus, the <em>timbre</em> was barely visible.</p>

<p>And he gave me a shit-load of meds, and now I have to apply some eardrops every 8 hours plus other pills and such. And now it doesn&rsquo;t hurt, so that&rsquo;s good!
And I&rsquo;m flying right now and wrote this as the plane was landing,
which is a completely unnecessary comment yet one
I chose to make.</p>

<p>Anyways, the subtitle of this blog post is <em>one without headphones</em>.
I chose not to bring my in-ear headphones because they are very uncomfortable and they might have been the cause to the infection in
the first place. So I chose not to bring them at all. But in the plane I was offered some. At first I thought of just saying no, but two people around me said yes so I kinda had to go with it, you know,
society ! But I just opened them, barely saw them, then put them in those bags in airplanes and I never used them at all during the plane ride.</p>

<p>I tried to not use digital devices during the flight. I didn&rsquo;t watch any movies because I didn&rsquo;t have any
over-ear headphones. Plus, I wanted to relax. I tried not to use my phone. Only at the end did I use it. I tried reading a book I had around, I started it a few days ago. It was published in 1980 and I found it at a small independent bookstore, for $10 Mexican pesos. That is, 50 cents of the American dollar. Yes, indeed!</p>

<p>Well, now to the book itself. It is called &ldquo;<strong>Petróleo</strong> <br>
<em>El recurso más allá de la capacidad de negociación.</em>&rdquo;
If you don&rsquo;t know Spanish it means &ldquo;Petroleum (or oil). More than just a bargaining tool&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And well, the book talks about oil, gas. Petroleum. It is pretty sincere in the fact that it&rsquo;s absorbed every conceivable physical
thing around us. And he&rsquo;s right. Still very true in 2022.</p>

<p>But guess what ? I tried to read several pages but I was falling asleep.
I barely read one page and after that just fiddled with my thoughts,
trying to ignore the crying and screaming from young children in front of me.</p>

<p>I eventually fell asleep. I got woken up to have some breakfast from the airline, since it was an almost four-hour flight. But I refused to have any breakfast, as I had already eaten before boarding the plane. Then I got offered some beverages,
I kindly accepted an orange juice.
It was nice, I could have ordered maybe a cup of water but I did not.
I was tired. Eventually I woke up
from my sleep. The person to my left was watching a random movie and the person to my right was also watching a movie. But I did not want to watch any movies or use my phone. Instead, I read and I read.
The book is nice. I haven&rsquo;t finished it, just read a few pages but the writing of the book interests me a lot. He uses grammatical expressions that one just does not find in a post-2000 book. It uses expressions which - at first - appear as nonsense but eventually make a tiny bit of sense.</p>

<p>The book is written in Spanish and
maybe some of them will not translate
well into English but I&rsquo;ll eventually put them up here.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough blogging
for today,
or is it ?</p>

<p>At least that was certainly my experience with it.</p>

<p>I recently installed macchanger <a href="#references">[0]</a>, a utility to&hellip; yes! change your mac address.</p>

<p>A MAC address stands for <em>Media Access Control address</em>. It is a unique identifier address used for network interface controllers (NICs, according to Wikipedia). So your LAN controller and your WiFi controllers have MAC addresses.</p>

<p>But companies and governments have standardized the way in which unique MAC addresses are set. I could, in theory, get into an insecure network and know how many devices are from X or why company. The FCC or some other organization assigns &lsquo;blocks&rsquo; that companies can use in order to set these MAC addresses. I think MAC addresses are used in network routers (e.g. the one your ISP gives you) to keep track of who has this or that IP address.</p>

<p>So as I sad in the beginning of this post, I tried changing my MAC address.
Because as of now, I could connect to my network and possibly know that this or that device is or this or that brand.
Which, in my opinion, is creepy as fuck.
So why not be more privacy minded ? So yeah, I tried changing my MAC address to a random one.</p>

<p>So you run the command. Nothing happens, it says that you should try using the <code>--help</code> flag, so I do. There is a <strong>random</strong> flag, just what I need. I do it. It tells me that I&rsquo;m missing something.
I read the manpage.
You have to specify the network adapter.
So I run <code>ip a</code>.
my computer is connected through an ethernet cable. I get the adapter name. I put it at the end of my command. Now I get permission denied. Fair enough, just use <code>sudo !!</code>. and it works!
Now I have another MAC address. But guess what ?</p>

<p>I go to sleep, I wake up the next day. I do not open my computer, do not check on it. The blog is fucked. I cannot sync anything. The server is inaccessible. Why ? Great question.</p>

<p>Then I try all kinds of stuff. I get to my house, I can access it from my Local Area Network. the IP address works. My public ports are fine. Then I remember, I changed the MAC address. Maybe I should restart my web server. That does not work. Neither does restarting the Network Manager.</p>

<p>I give up, I reset the MAC address to its default configuration. Maybe I cannot change the MAC address and <strong>not reboot.</strong></p>

<p>So now it works with the default MAC address.</p>

<h2>what kinds of string interpolation does POSIX sh support ?</h2>

<p><strong>By Gilles &lsquo;SO-stop being evil&rsquo;</strong>: source and license: <a href="#references">[0]</a></p>

<p><code>--BEGIN--TEXT</code></p>

<p><code>"${blah}"</code> and <code>"$blah"</code> are portable shell syntax: they work on all POSIX-compliant shells as well as in traditional Bourne shells. POSIX also requires other features of variable expansion:</p>

<ul>
<li>String manipulation with <code>${VAR#PREFIX}</code>, <code>${VAR##PREFIX}</code>, <code>${VAR%SUFFIX}</code> and <code>${VAR%%SUFFIX}</code>.</li>
<li>Conditional treatment of unset variables with <code>${VAR-DEFAULT}</code>, <code>${VAR=DEFAULT}</code>, <code>${VAR+FALLBACK}</code> and <code>${VAR?MESSAGE}</code> as well as the unset-or-empty variants with <code>:-</code>, <code>:=</code>, <code>:+</code> and <code>:?</code>.</li>
<li>Variable length with <code>${#VAR}</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>In all cases, remember that the result of <code>$…</code> undergoes whitespace-splitting (more precisely, splitting at <code>$IFS</code> characters) and wildcard expansion (globbing) unless it&rsquo;s in double quotes (or a few other contexts that don&rsquo;t allow multiple words).</p>

<p>You can look up what exists in POSIX by reading the specification. Modern versions of POSIX are identical to the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/shell.html">Open Group Base Specifications</a> (without optional components). Older versions are a subset of <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7990989775/xcu/shellix.html">Single Unix v2</a>.</p>

<p>Unix-like systems without a POSIX shell are extremely rare nowadays. <code>/bin/sh</code> is a non-POSIX Bourne shell on a few systems, notably Solaris, but a POSIX shell is available (<code>/usr/xpg4/bin/sh</code> on Solaris, and you should have <code>/usr/xpg4/bin</code> ahead of <code>/usr/bin</code> in your PATH). If you need compatibility with Bourne shells, check the man page on the systems you&rsquo;re interested in, as there have been many versions of sh with slightly different sets of features. <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/">Sven Mascheck maintains a page with a lot of information</a>.</p>

<p>Why am I writing the title in Spanish ? Hmmm, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Bueno, continuemos.</p>

<p>Aburrimiento. Algo que nos puede
pasar a todos. El estar solo, aislado nos puede provocar cosas raras en la cabeza.</p>

<p>¿ qué hacer ? qué somos ? el
ser intelectuales nos hace mejores personas ? para qué vivimos ?
a este punto sólo estoy diciendo mamada y media. Realmente no
he subido un artículo para mi blog
en un buen rato&hellip;.</p>

<p>Debería de leer un libro.</p>

<p>Pero por qué me avergonzaría leer
un libro que me ayudará a ser un mejor adolescente en frente de familiares no muy cercanos ?</p>

<p>Bueno, principalmente porque eso los considero <em>familiares no muy cercanos</em>. Y puede que surjan preguntas de todo tipo, cómo por
qué compré el libro en primera instancia, por qué lo estoy leyendo, por qué no estabas en la fiesta, por qué eres raro ?</p>

<p>Preguntas preguntas y más preguntas. El aislamiento es raro. Me gustaría profundizar en el tema.</p>

<p>Pero este post realmente sólo es una excusa para probar que funcione el push desde mi teléfono a mi servidor de git a través de HTTPS. Que raro, verdad ?</p>

<p>Read this story: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31009675">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31009675</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/">https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/</a></p>

<p>Okay, fine. The DLL injection
on the windows 10 uninstaller
is a fair vulnerability.</p>

<p>But what the hell happened to &lsquo;I own my machine&rsquo;. I can take pride
in fucking up and accepting my own decisions !?!?</p>

<p>where&rsquo;s the unix philosophy at ?</p>

<p>since when do I have to own a git repo to look at it? Wasn&rsquo;t this <strong>the</strong>
decentralized control versioning system created by Linus Torvalds?
The one that he kinda made in about 2 weeks but has been the top CVS for what ?, more
than 12 years now ?</p>

<p>I mean, this is an absurd decision.
Hundreds of CI/CD (Continuous integration / Continuous delivery ).</p>

<p>Even my fucking <strong>simple</strong> AF git hooks died. Since I am running
as another more-unprivileged user
now I don&rsquo;t have the right to clone a repo who&rsquo;s owned by another user in the system ? Seriously,
what the hell is wrong with that !?</p>

<p>This is, in my opinion, certainly
a stupid decision.</p>

<p>Oh my God ! It&rsquo;s my last day of school ! Well, I still
have another day tomorrow but we&rsquo;re practically doing nothing!
I still have like 3 final exams that I&rsquo;ll be doing this Friday
or the next week.</p>

<p>But whateveeeer ! Today I&rsquo;ve given myself the day.
I had a &lsquo;fiesta de cereal&rsquo; (yes, a cereal party) !
Everyone just brought a ton of sugary cereals, milk, almond milk,
other kinds of liquids that are called milk but I don&rsquo;t think
are actually milk, toppings, spoons, bowls, and glasses for drinking
and apparently serving the cereal !?</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t really feel that good. I feel kinda bad because I
was supposed to bring cereal and other stuff but I did not.</p>

<p>But now I feel bored. Yet with self-guilt, because I am not doing
what I am supposed to. I have some not-yet-done calculus assignments
that are not difficult, yet too easy. And that doesn&rsquo;t motivate me
to keep on going. I&rsquo;ve probably already passed the subject, and now
I just need to take the final exam and if I want finish those
calculus exercises. Which will most likely serve as practice, which
does help.</p>

<p>But why am I here? Just to suffer ? Who knooowwws mate! Also, I watched
a tv show for the first time in a while. And with another human
being. With a friend, actually. I watched the 2nd episode of
Mr. Robot (2016).
I&rsquo;ve already finished the show, yes, the whole four seasons. It really
brings out very dark yet astonishing thoughts within your mind. I
don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because I could spoil it. If you want
to watch it it&rsquo;s available on amazon prime. But hey, if you don&rsquo;t
want to give your money to one of the biggest e-commerce shopping
conglomerates around the world just send me an e-mail and maybe I&rsquo;ll
let you copy off the downloaded episodes I have. (Don&rsquo;t worry, I
still pay for amazon prime and I did watch it there first so -some -
money will definitely be going to the actors/director, etc&hellip;)</p>

<p>And the scenes. The writing style of the show. Very beautiful. Or
maybe I&rsquo;m just so fucking biased and I praise this show like
no other because I haven&rsquo;t watched that many dramas. Well, I&rsquo;ve also
watched House M.D. Yep, the whole eight seasons, baby! It gets boring
after a while. But point is, Mr. Robot is. And if you want you
may watch it, but I must say it does include sensitive and/or
disturbing content.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s what a good show is, right ? One that actually questions
your being, existence and merely mixes you in with the feelings
and does not merely end and your mind says: &ldquo;Oh well we&rsquo;re done here.&rdquo;
No, your mind <strong>Will want more</strong>!.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough blogging for today, plus dependencies.</p>

<p>So no, I&rsquo;m not done bloggging yet.</p>

<a name="dependencies"></a>
<h1>dependencies</h1>

<p>Dependencies are weird. This is some kind of buzz-word. A real
one, actually. It stands for what it means. At least in software.
A software, a program, or a set of programs, may depend upon other
programs to function. Libraries, let&rsquo;s say. Frameworks, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s this thing called dependency hell, from the internet
discussions I&rsquo;ve read it&rsquo;s mostly within the front-end web developing
space. But it could also happen in the backend. Certain software
requires certain, very specific, cryptic - even -,
versions of the software and sometimes software collides with other
software. Libraries are just collections of minified code (sometimes
not even minified) or maybe even compiled and using a shared library.
But there&rsquo;s just a gigantic web of tech stacks that we utilize on a
daily basis. That is why I strive for minimalism within my life.</p>

<p>Although sometimes extreme minimalism may lead to extreme dependencies,
which I am trying to - most definitely - get away from. Are friends
dependencies ? definitely !! They most of the time are. We sometimes
need them. Friends are there when needed, right ? But sometimes
they&rsquo;re always needed. Of course, that is bad, that&rsquo;s dependency hell.</p>

<p>Sometimes your thoughts wander way too much and you don&rsquo;t have time
to talk that much to people yet you&rsquo;d love to talk more and more and
more yet time is of the essence. And so is my life and so is theirs.</p>

<p>But generating dependencies is sometimes bad. when some of the code
is very simple to make, but tedious, you may go to using libraries.
But if a develper rants about not being paid enough money and
shutting down all his very minimalist packages and shutting down
very popular web services that says that something&rsquo;s very wrong
in the developer space. Not only for the fact that this guy&rsquo;s not
being paid enough ( which is meh ), but also because the developers
who were using <strong>his</strong> code did not plan ahead.</p>

<p>But hey, take my comments with a fucking grain of salt cause I&rsquo;m
still in high school if that counts. But maybe I&rsquo;ll get a headstart,
I&rsquo;m trying to get an internship.</p>

<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re at a mall or something, there&rsquo;s public
<em>WiFi</em>. Cool. And you can access the internet with your
phone. But you open your Linux computer and connect
to the network, yet nothing happens ! I&rsquo;ll show you
how to fix this.</p>

<p>Most public wifi networks use what is known as a
<strong><em>Captive Portal</em></strong>. It is merely a login page used
to authenticate control over Wi-Fi hotspots (Nyman, 2013).</p>

<a name="tdlr"></a>
<h1>tdlr</h1>

<p>just go to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> on a web browser.
It should redirect
you to the login page.</p>

<a name="tldr-2"></a>
<h1>tldr 2</h1>

<p>tldr didn&rsquo;t work ? Open a web browser, create an incognito window,
go to a website <strong>you&rsquo;ve never visited before</strong>. It should
redirect you to the login page.</p>

<a name="tldr-3"></a>
<h1>tldr 3</h1>

<p>get into a terminal. type the following command: <code>ip route</code>.
you should get something like:</p>

<p><pre><code>$ ip route
default via 192.168.1.1 dev zwn0 proto dhcp metric 600
172.17.0.0/16 dev docker0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.1 linkdown
192.168.1.0/24 dev wlan0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.68 metric 600
</code></pre>
get the first IP address under <em>default</em>. In this case, <code>192.168.1.1</code>.
That should redirect you to the login page. If none of these
solutions work, you should try reading this <a href="#references">[0]</a> stackoverflow
question. It has great explanations on what
could be going on, as well as multiple solutions.</p>

<a name="wut"></a>
<h1>wut</h1>

<p>if you&rsquo;re on a nice Desktop Environment (DE), the captive portal page
will most likely open for you just as you connect to the network.</p>

<a name="references"></a>

<p><em><strong>Note: This is a verbatim copy off the recipe found in the description off <a href="https://youtu.be/J6ujTlepWo0">this video.</a></strong></em></p>

<p>Cheese Garlic Bread</p>

<p>*** Please note that I have written down the expected questions as TIP.</p>

<p>You make your own fluffy bread, and the bread you eat when it&rsquo;s warm is really delicious.
The combination of the subtle garlic scent and the ever-stretching mochi cheese is the best.
It&rsquo;s not difficult to knead so let&rsquo;s make it together~</p>

<p>*** Weighing is scale (g), rice spoon (tbsp), teaspoon (tsp) weighing.</p>

<p>[Diameter 22cm]
✤ Ingredients for dough
  -200g Bread flour
  -1 Egg (can be omitted/replaced with milk)
  -20g Sugar (2tbsp)
  -4g Instant yeast (1tsp)
  -3g Salt (1tsp flat)
  -80ml Warm milk
  -30g Unsalted butter at room temperature</p>

<p>✤ Garlic sauce
  -1tsp Minced garlic
  -1tsp mayonnaise
  -1tsp sugar
  -0.5tbsp Chopped green onions
  -1tbsp Egg (can be omitted)
  -13g Unsalted butter at room temperature</p>

<p>✤ Topping
  -140g Mozzarella cheese</p>

<p>✤ TIP
  -Use bread flour as much as possible. plain flour has a less fluffy texture.
  -Fermentation can be done by soaking in warm water.
  -The airfryer temperature is similar to that of the oven. Adjust the temperature while looking at the color.</p>

<p>Yes, the Mark Zuckerberg!</p>

<p>More like&hellip; only one, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll make some commentary at the end.</p>

<p>I got it from <a href="#references">[0]</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the text:</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;-BEGIN TEXT&mdash;-</strong></p>

<p>10.28.03</p>

<p>8:13pm. I need to think of something to occupy my mind. Easy enough
now I just need an idea…</p>

<p>9:48pm. I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even 10pm and it’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland facebook is open on my computer desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.
I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive. It’s not such a great idea and probably not even funny, but Billy comes up with the idea of comparing two people from the facebook, and only sometimes putting a farm animal in there. Good call Mr. Olson! I think he’s onto something.</p>

<p>11:09pm. Yea, it’s on. I’m not exactly sure how the farm animals are going to fit into this whole thing (you can’t really ever be sure with farm animals…), but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel, since people’s ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person’s hotness like they do on hotornot.com. The other thing we’re going to need is a lot of pictures. Unfortunately, Harvard doesn’t keep a public centralized
facebook so I’m going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people arein.
And that means no freshman pictures…drats.</p>

<p>12:58pm. Let the hacking begin. First on the list is Kirkland. They keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration, so a little wget magic is all that’s necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook. Child’s play.</p>

<p>1:03am. Next on the list is Eliot. They’re also open, but with no indexes in Apache. I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in single page. Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me.
Excellent. Moving right along…</p>

<p>1:06am. Lowell has some security. They require a username/password combo to access the facebook. I’m going to go ahead and say that they don’thave access to the main fas user database, so they have no way of knowing what people’s passwords are, and
the house isn’t exactly going to ask students for their fas passwords, so it’s got to be something else. Maybe there’s a single username/password combo that all of Lowell knows.
That seems a little hard to manage since it would be impossible for the webmaster to tell Lowell residents how to figure out the username and password without giving them away completely. And you do want people to know what kind of authentication is necessary,
so it’s probably not that either. So what does each student have that can be used for authentication that the house webmaster has access to? Student ids anyone? Suspicions affirmed –time to get myself a matching name and student id combo for Lowell and I’m in. But there are more problems. The pictures are separated into a bunch of different pages, and I’m way too lazy to go through all of them and save each one. Writing a perl script to take care of that seems like the right answer. Indeed.</p>

<p>1:31am. Adams has no security, but limits the number of results to 20 a page. All I need to do is break out the same script I just used on Lowell and we’re set.</p>

<p>1:42am. Quincy has no online facebook. What a sham. Nothing I can do about that.</p>

<p>1:43am. Dunster is intense. Not only is there no public directory, but there’s no directory at all. You have to do searches, and if your search returns more than 20 matches, nothing gets returned. And once you do get results, they don’t link directly
to the images; they link to a php that redirects or something. Weird. This may bedifficult.
I’ll come back later.</p>

<p>1:52am. Leverett is a little better. They still make you search, but you can do an empty search and get links to pages with every student’s picture. It’s slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time, and there’s no way I’m going
to go to 500 pages to download pics one at a time, so it’s definitely necessary to break out emacs and modify that perl script. This time it’s going to look at the directory and figure out what pages it needs to go to by finding links with regexes. Then it’ll just go to
all of the pages it found links to and jack the images from them. It’s taking a few tries to
compile the script…another Beck’s is in order.</p>

<p>2:08am. Mather is basically the same as Leverett, except they break their directory down into classes. There aren’t any freshmen in their facebook…how weak.</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;-END TEXT&mdash;-</strong></p>

<a name="commentary"></a>
<h1>commentary</h1>

<p>Wow, nice story. I was definitely able
to follow through with what he was
saying.
Although I must say, I don&rsquo;t know
how to code in perl.
But I do know what PHP is! So that&rsquo;s good ?
Hmmm, a lot of the tech hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p>Would definitely be fun to make this as a challenge. Making
a faceSmash for my school !?</p>

<p>Dope! But a lot feminists would probably curse at me
for an entire week straight and
I could get expelled.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d probably just need to steal some
credentials off one professor who
has enough admin privileges.</p>

<p>Hmmm, maybe I&rsquo;ll go back to this.
Hey friends! Don&rsquo;t kill me, if you
don&rsquo;t want me to do this then
call me or something.</p>

<p>Maybe this is placebo but point is I kind of am a distracted person
and feel like my heart is pounding relatively fast.</p>

<p>Yet today I decided to drink at seven in the <code>p.m.</code> one and a half
cups of american medium-roasted coffee from <em>Garat</em>. and i ate
it with some cookies. maybe too many cookies. Then I started
using my phone like a crazy person and started sending a shit-ton
of links to a friend. Maybe I went overboard with the links.</p>

<p>And the coffee kinda made me happy. I&rsquo;ve never felt this alive before.</p>

<p>Like ideas just flow into my head and I execute them. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just
being very reactive to my vices. Since, yes, being on instagram for like
five hours straight is not healthy. Also, I got on a call with another
friend and helped him out on a school project which I hadn&rsquo;t even started
at the time,
then got him to let me join his team. The code was
almost kind of done, and he made most of it. I feel bad for that. Kinda.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. But maybe without me he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten the last
coding part. We barely saw any programming principles in class.</p>

<p>Also, is it ok to have for dinner only oatmeal with some granola ? And then
take antidepressants and an antibiotic ? I hope I don&rsquo;t fuck up my stomach.</p>

<p>My keyboard definitely makes a ton of noises when typing.</p>

<a name="i-feel-useless"></a>
<h1>i feel useless</h1>

<p>yes, indeed I do.
Even though I can provide ideas, experiencie and opinions within
my area of expertise,
I do not fill fulfilled.</p>

<p>I feel <strong>not useful</strong>. I am
trying to teach someone something
but they really don&rsquo;t get it!
They barely get it at all!
You are a good person, kinda trying
to understand but you&rsquo;re not at all putting in the effort.
I explain, you look at me in deception and
I try to explain but you barely make
any questions.</p>

<p>I had already teached you some
of this which means that you
are either a) very distracted and
not interested in learning about
this topic; b) you don&rsquo;t like me,
you&rsquo;re thinking of something bad
or arrogant I made; or c) your
incentives to learn are
non-existant.</p>

<p>That is bad. Any of these problems
is bad. Some worse than others.
Communication <strong>is key</strong>. Yet
you don&rsquo;t say shit.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t seem to want to learn.
I think I&rsquo;m trying my best in
order to teach but neither
am I inspired at all. I don&rsquo;t
like working for tyrants.</p>

<hr />

<p>And you know, after being absent
on a team and being occupied at
other things - for several hours -
I can tell you that my opinions are
not valuable to the team. I try
to give ideas, let others be yet
the design we were working on
went to fucking trash and we started
doing everything from the start.</p>

<p>And I truly try to help but none
of the actions I critique are valuated. I can say good job or whateved but at this point I&rsquo;m
practically nonexistent.</p>

<p>A very relatable song. Just listen to the
crisp lyrics:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/g5W7Dg_Lof4">Waste my Time - Crystal Casino Band</a> (youtube)</p>

<p>Oddly enough, this song appeared as an <em>advert</em> in an instagram story. I was just bored at a party after a while and I started using my phone and then lo and behold some radio frequencies that we humans interpret as sound and my brain - me - has appreciated it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just never found such a relatable song as of now. Is this happiness ? Does it transfer sadness? Not sure, yet.</p>

<p>weird, right !?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the <code>fc-list</code> command.
This binary is installed with the <code>fontconfig</code> package on Arch Linux.</p>

<p>But if you don&rsquo;t want to install <code>1.1 MB</code> of not-so-useful
stuff, you can list your installed fonts by going to this directory:</p>

<p><code>/usr/share/fonts</code></p>

<p>then you can run something like <code>tree</code>. There will be several folders and
a ton of <code>.ttf</code> files.
my dir listing looks like this:</p>

<p><pre><code>&gt; ls /usr/share/fonts
adobe-source-code-pro  gnu-free           liberation  old            ttf-linux-libertine
cantarell              gsfonts            misc        TTF            xscreensaver
encodings              kanjistrokeorders  noto        ttf-jetbrains

</code></pre>
you can now get all your installed fonts on your Linux system!</p>

<p>Donc aujourd'hui ma professeur de français a voulé de faire
un revue de toute les conjugaison en français.</p>

<a name="pass-c3--a9--compos-c3--a9-"></a>
<h1>passé composé</h1>

<p>Donc on a commencé par le passé composé: très simple. C'est
seulement la formule:</p>

<p><pre><code>passé composé = auxiliare + participe passé
</code></pre>
où <code>l'auxiliaire</code> est <em>être</em> ou <em>faire</em>. Le verbes qui doivent
être conjugés avec <code>être</code> sont tous les verbes pronominaux et
les verbes de &lsquo;mouvement&rsquo; ( avec la maison etc&hellip;)</p>

<a name="imparfait"></a>
<h1>imparfait</h1>

<p>c'est pour décrire des habitudes</p>

<p>et je suis un peux ennuyé d'écrire.</p>

<p>Mais, merde!</p>

<p>Comment est que notre langue a evolutionné</p>

</p>


<p>I will - at least for now - not tell you the specifications, but what
can be seen closest from the eye.</p>

<p>First, a quote from Mahatma Gandhi, whom I barely know. I only know
that he has been one of the most important human rights activists around
the world, or at least that has been portrayed by the Western Media. I
know he is from India and was part of several peaceful protests to
liberate the country from Britain.</p>

<p>The quote is short, yet simple.</p>

<blockquote><p>Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very<br>
important that you do it.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, even when you think that whatever you are doing might
not have an effect on society or others, it might actually have it;
even if it&rsquo;s not so obvious. Maybe successful people, startup leaders,
millionaires will say that this is merely obvious. Maybe because
successful or &lsquo;popular&rsquo; people within the success bubble are used
to growing a real kind-of-an-ass conscience. Success can be seen
in many ways. But I think that people ultimately want power. Power
leads to control. Some of these may be achieved with money. But
others just with commitment. Commitment to follow your gut,
not just fucking numbers. Who cares if people say that nobody
will want electric scooters or that selling books through
weird screens that connect through the telephone and make
weird noises will revolutionize the industry. Success stories
from tech are just so inspiring to me for some reason. They
certainly committed to some of their dreams and actually
did them. Even if they were at the brink of losing it all.
Just like when Elon Musk invested almost all of his money in
Tesla and attempted to create an actually good electric
vehicle. and he made a nice sports car. Respect. But now his
company kinda sucks, he uses proprietary software and doesn&rsquo;t
let people hack their car. Just bans people from their
super-charger network. Limits right-to-repair on the car. But
Tesla&rsquo;s mission was never to be a good company. It was to revolutionize
the <code>car industry</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Well, yeah. technically tesla was not founded by Elon Musk.</strong>
<strong>More like he was the fucking angel investor who took his chances and </strong>
<strong>bought like 90% of the stock even when the company was almost doomed</strong>
<strong>to fail.</strong></p>

<p>So yeah, <code>tesla's</code> mission is not to be a good company, or create a good
product. Maybe they are kind of attempting to do this, or they were at some
point in time. They merely wanted to spark competition. This has made very
big companies to heavily invest in real electric vehicle technology. Including
some that Tesla may not even have. But are electric vehicles really a good
thing ? Not sure.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll talk about that in another article. Let&rsquo;s move on to the next
quote from my terminal.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>Wu wei</p></blockquote>

<p>I actually forgot what this meant. Somewhere on the internet I stumbled
upon chinese philosophy. After a quick duckduckgo search I found out that
<code>Conficius</code> was kind of the guy who coined the term. It comes from
<em>taoism</em>, a philosophy of life - sometimes referred to as a religion
<a href="#references">[0]</a>. In Chinese, <code>wu wei</code> literally means inaction.
It refers to actions that are effortlessly executed without even
thinking about them, just doing them and aligning to our needs, not
our desires.</p>

<p>next phrase.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>CONTROL your vices</p></blockquote>

<p>this is a phrase I made up. Control. Meaning, <code>Get a handle of...</code>.
your vices. <code>my vices</code>. vices meaning these things, attitudes,
actions, thoughts that may take your life and thoughts away
from what you have to do.</p>

<p>and then an almost verbatim
definition from the merriam webster dictionary of the
word <code>vice</code></p>

<blockquote><p>vice          (Merriam Webster)
\ ˈvīs \
Definition of vice (Entry 1 of 4)
1.
b: a moral fault or failing
2. : BLEMISH, DEFECT
5. : an abnormal behavior pattern in a domestic animal
detrimental to its health or usefulness.</p></blockquote>

<p>first definition: <code>a moral fault or failing</code>. Moral. Talks about morals.
Kinda good and wrong. Fault. Something that may have been wrong, corrupted.
Failing. Not working well.</p>

<p>second definition: <code>BLEMISH, DEFECT</code>. simply something that is not supposed
to be there.</p>

<p>third definition. <code>an abnormal behavior pattern in a domestic animal</code>
<code>detrimental to its health or usefulness</code>. weird but ok. but the most
correct one, I&rsquo;d say. I am domesticated. By my own conscience and
rationality. I am indeed an animal. A human animal. Aware of its
conscience. And yes, <code>vices</code> are detrimental, <strong>detrimental</strong> to
the health or usefulness to the creatures who are executing them.</p>

<hr />

<p>and last but not least, quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>carpe diem</p></blockquote>

<p>Latin for <code>seize the day</code>. I first heard of this on the movie
<code>The dead poets society</code>. Very good movie. Sad, but true. Yet
really captures reality. it is simply a phrase for living in the
moment, not worrying about past or future or maybe not even having
a notion of time! But wait. The phrase already mentions &lsquo;day&rsquo;. A
word that can only be interpreted if we have time, right. Well,
yeah. I just thought about that. But there&rsquo;s not much to it.
Maybe if you put my face in front of you i&rsquo;d be a tad bit more inspired
to talk to you about the why I chose these phrases to appear every
time I open my terminal. But whatever. have a nice day.</p>

<p>end.</p>

<a name="references"></a>
<h1>references</h1>

<ul>
<li>[0] : sometimes Taoism is referred to as a religion because it can be
something  that people believe in. Yet it sometimes is refuted because
there isn&rsquo;t a strong base in what to believe, there is not a God or
a church. It is more a school of thought than a group of followers.</li>

<p>what the film <code>NUMBER 2</code> here:
<a href="https://youtu.be/hZFm6bIqeh8">https://youtu.be/hZFm6bIqeh8</a></p>

<p><details>
    <summary>
    <em>Click here to view my review. With spoilers of course.</em>
    </summary></p>

<p>The film tests the boundaries at which we will conserve
and preserve and save <em>intimacy</em>. And <em>embarassment</em>. I guess
Danish women aren&rsquo;t expected to fart randomly at a supermarket or
in front of a male friend, are they ? Pretty embarassing if you
ask me. I don&rsquo;t understand why she didn&rsquo;t go to the store bathroom;
maybe there wasn&rsquo;t one&hellip;</p>

<p>Of course, we shall discuss other things. Like the fact that she
didn&rsquo;t want to tell her friend that she was actually busy and
instead held a relatively long conversation with her friend.</p>

<p>I guess boundaries go a long way. Just as she did not have the trust
to say I have an emergency she might do that when not feeling safe.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine how humans will work under a society
based on rules and social movements, structures, and just anything
at all. Like how do you define what&rsquo;s acceptable ? is it f'ing ok
to say &ldquo;Hey I have to fucking poop, get out of the way!&rdquo; ? I
would probably say that. Because I&rsquo;m honest, sincere. I appreciate
honesty. I don&rsquo;t like to bluff. If someone wants me out of people&rsquo;s
private conversations and I&rsquo;m there. I won&rsquo;t leave until these
people tell me. And if I get the cue that they&rsquo;re telling me
to gtfo, well then I will tell them ok but to just be direct.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what else to say. Seems like people put big effort into this film.</p>

<p>It uses several examples of embarassment as away
to engage the viewer, or maybe not. Maybe that&rsquo;s the <code>5,4,3,2,1...</code> at the
beginning. That kinda gives us a feeling of fake nostalgia that never
happened. Because who&rsquo;s actually watched a real movie with those countdown
numbers. But now I&rsquo;m criticizing myself for saying &lsquo;real movie&rsquo;. what is
that, anyways? How do you define a good movie ? A good film ? Was
this a short film ? Or just a film ? Would it be bad to name this as
a good film, who decides a good length for a film. Why should the amount
of effort matter or the amount of time or anything at all.</p>

<p>Humans <strong>have reason</strong>. Or a conscience, as we say. We are incapable
of imagining thoughts without being aware of the thoughts themselves.
Very weird indeed. And yet we live in society; we communicate
and have these complex hierarchy instructions that sometimes let
us have more power, and therefore more control, and money.</p>

<p>What is it that we ultimately want in life ? Don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Maybe I went too far on this one. Let me know if this sucks or rocks!</p>

<p>Yes. And there was light, after darkness.
And there was darkness after the light;
yet no one in the whisper town seemed to know for sure when they were.</p>

<p>Today&hellip; was a weird day!?</p>

<p>Yes, believe me mate.
Morning, as usual.<br>
I woke up late, I was not due early; my sister had to be on campus
until eleven in the morning. So I was going with my mum. *sigh*.</p>

<p>Yep. But I hadn&rsquo;t showered the day before, nor the day before that.
So it was time, I had to do something, make something in order
to make myself not feel so bad for not showering enough.</p>

<p>So you know what I did ? No ? Yes ? Well, I showered. And I sure fucking did.
Boiling hot water. Soap. Shampoo. Cold. Morning. Not-that-late. Water.
Sink. I showered.</p>

<p>I started rinsing my whole body with this prestigious liquid that supposedly
keeps me - and humans - alive. Water. Did I like it ? Kinda, I was thirsty.
My throat was soar.</p>

<div style=font-size:8px > My throat is still soar as of writing this. </div>


<p>Then I applied my face skin care soap. A bar of soap. Create a puddle of soapy
oatmealed liquid in your hands. A cave. A round cave. You make foam. You make
light. Yet you smash that light on yer face. My face.</p>

<p>You scrub hard enough for some oily stuff to kinda come off your face. You wash.
You wash. You scrub with water going all over your face. Kinda hot, <em>innit</em> ?
Yes, hot. rinse, rinse; rinse rinse!!!</p>

<p>Now Shampoo. Just soak all your hairs in water. (HAAAAIIIIR!!)</p>

<div style=font-size:8px >
nooooooo ://. you will learn why in not so long.</div>


<p>Then apply the liquid shampoo.</p>

<hr />

<p>Me, as I&rsquo;m writing this:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is starting to get cold. It is April the 20th. <br>
I was hoping for more sun.<br>
It&rsquo;s kinda coming out. The Sun.<br>
And there was light.<br></p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Okay, so shampoo. Boring. Boring little details. No. My hair was numb, it wasn&rsquo;t numb
it was just weird. Greasy, greasy. Barely combed. My hair was tangled in itself.
The hot water helps much more than cold water.
It helps to untangle the hair. Make it more uniform,
real. Maybe even crisp. Shampoo. A fancy load on the palm of my hand. Shampoo.
Hard to follow? I&rsquo;m writing this from my keyboard, words are more difficult
to describe than before. Am I imagining things ? Remembering ? Is my writing bad ?</p>

<p>Who knows man! Let&rsquo;s hope I know !</p>

<p>Anyways, I shower. Ins and outs. Well here, well there. Not so much blue soap.
Because I&rsquo;m too lazy to go get a new one maybe 30 feet away.</p>

<p>Okayyyy, so showwweeeeer.</p>

<p>Why did I shower ? Well, I ws supposed to shower yesterday. Yet I did not. Yesterday
I went with my friends to a bowling place. Bowl. As in those weird cones that they make
with some cutting rotary tool; they cut wood, well, into <strong>bowls</strong>. Not the kind
of bowls you eat popcorn in. The kind of bowls you make fall with a big, gian, ball made
of God-knows-what. <code>but no, I am not religious, as of yet. But I think I should be</code>
Yes, TDA, Gaby.</p>

<p>I am ashamed of it. Yes. I have met another human being with TDA. Ecstatic to
meet another human being with the same thing. Ecsatic I was not, but the person
whom I met. But she told me that she did not have her meds. There was (is) a big
medication shortage for psychiatry. Yes, the kind that cures depression and the kind
that helps with TDA, trastorno de deficit de atencion. Or Attention deficit disorder.
ADD. weird. name. but ok. So I was ashamed because I did not want to take my meds,
but I kinda was taking them. But they were not working. I think they are not working
now. But you know what? There is a certain limit to what taking a 3-gram pill
everday in your system can change in your bodi and bodily fluids. Brain is weird.
I have conscience. I am aware of my medications. My dose has increased.
It is weird, yet I am kinda still not in the zone. I go and go and merry-go
-fucking-round. Feelings are weird. I am not yet disciplined enough to get to French!</p>

<p>Oh, french! Fuck french! No, you love French. Hecto, you love french. you are asleep yet awake writing
whatever the fuck comes to mind. You are kinda lucid. You are not lucid. You are alive. same as lucid,
you asshole! Lucid is almost the same as alive. But I mean lucid. As in lucid
dream. So by lucid you meant lucid dream ? Yeah, man.</p>

<p>You are not in a lucid dream. I think. YOu are not. I f we are, it&rsquo;s been
a little fucking long time to wake up.</p>

<p>What loneliness ? Loneliness, son !? Nah, just your thoughts. Perception.</p>

<p>Frencxh!!! We were in French.
I did not arrive early to French. I got finished showering at around seven twenty
in the <code>a.m.</code>; I went to the kitchen. I ate. Ate, eaty-eaty y'all. Wait, I&rsquo;m
lying to you. I did not finish showering at <code>seven twenty in the a.m.</code>. I
think I was by the kitchen at around <code>seven thirty-three in the a.m.</code> SO no,
I was not early. Yes, I was already late to the kitchen, I think. Thoughts
are weird (see <code>no thoughts, head empty</code> music playlist).</p>

<p>Anyways, so much information. Going through my head, right now. Conditions
apply. <em>Strings definitely attached</em>. Comes with prethreaded brain. And
a ton-shit of thread to re-string or just add new strings, new ideas. New
recursion and inception of thoughts. You can go as far as you want, as long
as you don&rsquo;t fucking over-boil your head, or overheat it. Don&rsquo;t overheat my
head, mate!</p>

<p>Okay, so I ate egg. Egg. With red tomato. <code>jitomates</code> in Spanish. The <code>ji</code> is
for red. you can probably guess what <code>tomates</code> stands for.
So I did not like the egg. My Mother was there. It was cold. The egg was
cold. Not warm, at all. We were late. Father came. Do not remember what
parents talked about after that. Finished eating boring egg; cold boring
egg. But I did drink water. Then drank medicine. Well, more like popped
my meds like candy! (yes, <code>m.d. house</code> reference).</p>

<p>Okay, so I went away&hellip; nOOOOOOOO
Fuck fuc k fuck. I just remembered waht my mother and father talked to me
about whilst in the kitchen. Weirrrd. I will not tell you. Because I do not
want to overheat my brain and go into so many levels of remberance or inception,
as I seemed to have baptized this phenomena. Phenomenon. Phenomena ( with an
accent, tilde, kinda) aaaaaaaaaaaaa;; dont' start again man!</p>

<p>Okay, anyways. I went away to wash my teeth. Teeth in mouth. Where the fuck
else ? Don&rsquo;t be sad. I washed my teeth. I got my phone, my charger, my
knife, my car keys, my suit. I went downstairs. Downstairs, that was the word!</p>

<p>And I started to gather all my shit. I put the charger in the bag. I put the
phone in the suit. I put the wallet in the suit. I suited up. Nice pun!</p>

<p>I went for lunch. I gathered everything. I put things in the car. I went
away with my mom. Time was probably around <code>7:43 in the a.m.</code>. in the a.m.
nice words. We were late. My Mom kept telling me that I should not be
this late! I&rsquo;m an asshole!!! Yet I was there, arguing with my mom, playing
the devil&rsquo;s advocate sometimes and other times just bashing out my own
thoughts, <strong>mate!</strong></p>

<p>Okay. So I got maybe like at seven o six in the a.m. To school. I need
to pass a stupid covid-filter. I did not. I ran. They only take temperature
and ask for your student identification. I opened my wallet, where the
identification was visible. All this while I was running. They understood.
They empathized. THey thankfully did not stop me. Thank you madam, and sir.</p>

<p>Then I ran to the french classroom. Same as almost any other classroom.
Except that classroom&rsquo;s name is <code>la progracueva</code>. But that ain&rsquo;t important.
What&rsquo;s important is that  I was late. I thought the teacher was not going
to let me through. Yet I sat down. She was mad. I was the only one late.
Fuck. Why is it that every time I arrive actually early to my french classroom
my teacher starts taking attendance late ??? Whyyy ??</p>

<p>Today she took attendance early&hellip;. SO yeah, fuck. But I did the assignments.
I finished the teamwork, I was the admin. For once. Not for once you sucker,
like many other times like 95% of the times in the french classroom. Where
my class mates say literally shit and don&rsquo;t know how to speak a dime of
french and I have to fuck up my french on purpose so that they don&rsquo;t look
bad and don&rsquo;t get a grade that bad.</p>

<p>Anyways. I went to calculus class. The medicine worked. Gaby and Fer
went away. They said they had finished the work. I don&rsquo;t know if they did.
No care. But problem is that I wanted to go with them, but something stopped
me. The fact that there was still a handful of people inside the classroom.
The fact that maybe I missed having Gaby around and talking to her yet if I
had gone outside the classroom I would have been with her but what the
actual fuck am I saying !? Not in a like-miss way, just in a friend
enjoying deeply intellectual - not actually intellectual but there&rsquo;s
definitely a better word for it - conversations.</p>

<p>But my friend Jenny and Alex would not get up. They were committed to finishing
schoolwork. They were not finishing it. No distractions. No nothing, they were
both finishing their assignments individually. Alex was, helping - every once
in a while - Jenny with confirming mathematical procedures. For
<strong>integration by parts</strong>  Pretty weird topic if you ask me. It&rsquo;s recursive.
Meaning you may <strong>need</strong> to execute the integration by parts in some steps
that you&rsquo;ve gathered from executing the integration by parts. Running the
same function for given values until you get more useful values that
you can use in order to get even more useful values and maybe even an
integral that actually works!</p>

<p>So yeah. These two friends.  good friends. best friends I&rsquo;d say, I also
have other best friends, you know ? okay, fine. SO these best friends
inspired me by not saying anything but by doing and helping each other
out. They did not budge. they did not give away their stance. They stood
their ground. They finished their calculus procedure. About halfway of their
procedures I started mine. With the first one. Morel ike I started doing
it once Jenny had finished all of them. Five integration by parts problems.
I started from scratch. Zero. nada. nothing. I executed first
order in list. I opened my notebook, wrote it down with a blue pen. No, not
with a blue pen but everything in pencil. Not in a pencil <em>per se</em> but in
a mechanical pencil. So yeah. Life do be like that. I got the first one
kind of wrong. I was calculating an integral when I had to do a derivative.
Weird cows and shit. You&rsquo;ll get it when you get it.</p>

<p>So yeah, Alex Gomez told me about that. then I flied. and i flied and i flied
and I got everything right and was checking it with Jenny&rsquo;s procedure. Good,
I guess. Then I got stuck in the 5th question and Alex helped me a tad bit
out. Or did he ? I think he did. So, anyways, these two were awaiting
for my finish. I took a document scan on my phone, exported it to a
<code>portable document format</code> file format. Then uploaded it to the platform
where we were supposed to upload the calculus assignment. And I did,
I thanked Jenny. I thanked Alex. We went away. then i don&rsquo;t know what
I did. Wait, I don know. I had lunch.</p>

<p>I was kinda mad. I felt bad for the teacher. Actually, before
Gaby - my friend - left the calculus class, she helped me out and
gave me recommendations on how to be better-disciplined. She helped.
I did not practice but she gave me good brain-tricking theory.
Thanks, Gaby. Anyways, Delphine, french teacher. woman. with a tiny
kid. I had to do something, I though of going to talk to her office.</p>

<p>But I never actually did ? Why ? no idea&hellip;</p>

<p>Okay, so now was time to get my lunch. I confused cars and eventually
found it. It was open, of course. Because my mom knew I hadn&rsquo;t grabbed
my lunch. Thanks, Mom. So I, of course, grabbed the lunch. My lunch.
Partly prepared by my mom. Oh, fuck! My mom brought food from the house
for me. Yet I bought food at the cafeteria. What an asshole I am.</p>

<p>Fuckfuckfuckfuc. okay, so back to food. Went for food, went for bottle
of water. went for bottle of tequila. No, unfortunately not, I donot
drink - yet. So I went to the benches where my friends were at. But
I had peeing desires. I wanted to pee. Actually, I want to pee right
now, mate. <code>should i stay or should i go ? best thing i got out</code>
<code>of stranger things. the glorious name and feel and existence of this song!.</code></p>

<p>Okay, so I actually did go to pee. See the commit history for this file.</p>

<p>So, as I was saying, I went for lunch. Then I went to pee.
Then I ate, was on my phone. accompanied my friends Pau and Fer for some
<em>chocoflan</em> but there wasn&rsquo;t any ! :( . I was definitely expecting chocoflan.
But it unfortunately did not happen. I wanted chocoflan. But then encountered
Ernesto Caso, a former <em>tecbotian</em>. Well, he still is a <em>tecbotian</em>.</p>

<p>anyways, I waited for my friend Fer who was, in turn, expecting her food
from a cafeteria place. She had ordered a croissant. After some minutes
Fer did get the croissant and went to the eating benches. Or just
benches, mate. And we ate. ate, and ate. Eventually I talked to Pau.</p>

<p>about her boyfriend, weird. Her boyfriend seems nice. I won&rsquo;t
reveal too much personal information but he is from Switzerland. So yeah.
She has only seen him once.</p>

<p>Then it was eleven o'clock. and duty was to go and see Juan Pablo, J.P.
A very dedicated person. highly disciplined to do anything he wants.
I believe in him. But times change. And so did this one. We were expecting
him at an auditorium with another group of people to see him defend
his portfolio with all the accomplishments during his stay at
high school. But we got the times wrong. Maybe I did not hear correctly.</p>

<p>So we went to anothe auditorium, but no one was there. We then went to a
third one. No one was in any of the auditoriums. I wrote JP. He did not
answer. He eventually did, saying that the time at which he would present
would be thirteen-hundred hours. <code>one in the p.m.</code></p>

<p>So then we had time to kill. But I went to the bathroom. Again. This time
to poop. But I took a long time. Almost every time I get to any bathroom
I complain in my head and pretend as if  I were writing a blog post - like
this one - in which I complain about the automatic sensors that don&rsquo;t
work sometimes. You go to poop. When you get up, toilet flushes. That is
the objective. In practice, if I move a tad bit - while pooping - it will
flush. sometimes. But that day I also complained about the lighting. For this
specific toilet. It&rsquo;s good and all to absorb natural light. But there
was and barely is any light available for this toilet. Literally <strong>ALL</strong>
the lighting for the pee-only bathroom and the handicapped toilet
are perfectly lit, even with <em>artificial lighting!</em>. But this one
toilet is enclosed in a small space and does not have any light over it.</p>

<p>So yeah. I took a long time in the bathroom. Questioning things. Pooping.
I don&rsquo;t remember much from today&rsquo;s toilet-go.</p>

<p>Then I returned to the eating benches. No one was there. A few minutes came
by, Fer arrived. She told me everyone was at the workshop. good, I said.
I told her that <em>maybe</em> I&rsquo;d accompany them. She said ok, then left. Then I left.
I was missing water. I wanted water. I wanted sun. I wanted music. My throat
was - still - sore.</p>

<p>So I went to <em>Arqui</em>. Plenty of sun. A lake, grass. some benches. some chairs,
some rocking chairs. some inclinated chairs. some fancy inclinated chairs.
So I went. And enjoyed the sun. And enjoyed the music I was listening too.</p>

<p>I went to fetch water. I went to the restroom. Then my phone started getting
hot because the sun was so awesome and I like the sun and it was near
overheating and unusable because iOS stops the software if it&rsquo;s near the sun
death.</p>

<p>So I went back. At this point, it was certainly past eleven in the a.m.
and it was near noon, a.k.a. twelve in the p.m.
Close to my physics class. In terms of time, at least.</p>

<p>So I went to the tecbot workshop, my friends were there.
We went to physics class. There, I talked to my friends, discussed
on the architecture of our bridge and then went away with <em>The Mickey</em>
and <em>the powerful Gaby</em>. I got some glue, stole some pasta from
my friends. then we parted away to CITEC. a place where there are
computer and fancy big laser color printers. And we logged into a
computer. Looked again at designs because why not, while talking about
pretty heated topics on anything at all. I kinda met Mickey, I got to
know a few things here and there about him. After that, we actually
started building structures for our <strong><em>pasta-and-glue-only</em></strong> bridge.</p>

<p>And we talked and talked and talked. Mainly with Gaby. Some time with
Mickey. then it was time. remember about <code>thirteen-hundred</code> ? one
in the p.m. ? Yes, it was JP&rsquo;s presentation. We were kinda late. We
tried to wrap up as quickly as possible while maintaining the strucure of
our pieces and wrapping them in newspaper so that they could dry out in
pure calmness. So we ran, towards the <em>Auditorium 1</em>. One.</p>

<p>So now we&rsquo;re in the auditorium. But J.P. is not the first person to present.
He was actually the last. whatever. the other presentations were fine. They
did great. It&rsquo;s public speaking. Today there were more and more and many more
friends.  The auditorium was presque-full.</p>

<p>And then it was two o'clock. And I was kinda tired.  I was tired. I am
tired. then I honestly don&rsquo;t remember much about anything.</p>

<p>eventually, a friend told me that some people were cutting hair and giving it
away to people without hair. I had thought about this altruistic act for a long
time. Several months, I&rsquo;d say. But I&rsquo;d keep making excuses to not do anything.</p>

<p>So I though, why the fuck not be altruistic ? My hair will grow, some people
won&rsquo;t have the grace or the beautiful act of feeling hair. So I though
why not give it away ?</p>

<p>So I did. And now my hair feels very weird. I don&rsquo;t like the cut. They cut like
maybe 25 cm. And that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>I ate something. Good bye. Maybe I will sleep soon.</p>

<p><em>You shook me all night long.</em> <strong>AC / DC</strong></p>

<p>For those who were not in Mexico at the time, apparently the Earth trembled.
It shook.</p>

<p>The epicenter seemed to originate from Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. I hope
everyone is fine. I definitely felt it here in Toluca, several hundred
kilometers away.</p>

<p>note: my friend Gaby thinks that I did not touch entropy enough. Fair enough, <em>I don&rsquo;t really dive into the definition or the concept.</em></p>

<p>Okay, so I just got back from Veracruz. As usual, I am procrastinating
and not doing my calculus assignment; instead, I&rsquo;ll tell you about
a story about entropy, destiny, and I do not know what else.</p>

<p>Okay, so I was in Veracruz, up until Saturday. On Saturday I went away
- with my family - to Tlaxcala, about halfway to where I live.
On Sunday we continued
the route and got to my house. Then we unpacked, my parents told me
to actually get all my stuff up to my room so that they wouldn&rsquo;t take up
that much space in the house. Then we rested for a little bit and
went away to eat, since there wasn&rsquo;t much food in the house. We had
been away for about a week.</p>

<p>Then, while we were in the car, I realized
I was <strong>not</strong> wearing my seatbelt. Weird thing was that this SUV always
beeps with a very fucking high pitch when someone does not have their seatbelt
on.</p>

<p>But how might the vehicle detect if someone is not using their seatbelt ?
Well, the seatbelt buckle is made of metal, so maybe there&rsquo;s two terminals in
the seatbelt socket that close a circuit. And it only beeps if there&rsquo;s weight
on the seat. But the thing is that if you&rsquo;re already in the car - without
your seatbelt- and then you start the car, the car will think that you&rsquo;re just
a load, meaning it won&rsquo;t complain if you do not have your seatbelt on. All of
this I am assuming from my very few experiences in this SUV, in (or on?)
the passenger seat.</p>

<p>So, anyways, I am going out to eat. In this car, with my family. I do not
have my seatbelt on. Then I think, what are the odds that we crash while I
do not have my seatbelt on ? Hmmm, who knows I think. Just a not-so-odd
thought that popped into my head. All of a sudden, a car from the other side
of the road - who was going in the opposite direction - just turned and gased
the pedal and went into our side of the road while my dad was going through
a green. I think she wanted to park but wanted to have better visibility when
exiting. So she ( I think ) was going to go left, would then backup and align
to
the parking spot. Which is- as you might expect- perpendicular to the road.</p>

<p>So then my father pressed the brakes so hard that I could have died. Nah, just
joking, I don&rsquo;t think I would have died. Maybe if I had been in the middle
seat. But I was on the right-passenger seat. Without my seatbelt. So my
reflexes came in and I just started to try and make tension with my legs and
push towards the copilot seat so that my legs would take the force of the
sudden breaking and I wouldn&rsquo;t have a bruise on my head. So yeah, that&rsquo;s that.
Then my father started to bash the horn so hard that it was probably heard on
the whole intersection and maybe several meters away.</p>

<p>yeah, entropy is so fucking weird. What was the probability that whilst I was
thinking the probability of being in a crash whilst not wearing my seatbelt
I would crash ? Probably a whole fucking lot. But hey, maybe math or
statistics people will tell me that I&rsquo;m an asshole for not wearing my seatbelt
because the probability is reasonably high because just look at the birthday
paradox. The probablity that 100 people will have the same birthday is super
high even though there&rsquo;s 365 days to choose from.</p>

<p>I do not know what else to say. Maybe I will blog later in the day, I will
try to stop procrastinating now. arrivederci, my dudeees. ( my fork
of the <code>it's wednesday my dudeees...</code> vine ).</p>

<a name="on-web-browsers-and-GUI-apps"></a>
<h1>on web browsers and GUI apps</h1>

<p>So apparently linux lets you use the keybinding <code>Ctrl+Shift+U</code> to
insert utf-8 characters, literally any utf-8 character. This is in
a non-terminal application such as libreOffice, Chromium, Firefox, etc.</p>

<p>Why does this work ? No idea. Don&rsquo;t know if this comes directly
from the kernel - or X11 / xorg -  but yeah, it works and I can type stuff
like:</p>

<p>1 + 1 = √2</p>

<p>yes, that&rsquo;s a square root symbol in raw unicode ! without using
microsoft word with a laggy interface or whatever.</p>

<a name="utf-2d-8-symbols-on-vim"></a>
<h1>utf-8 symbols on vim</h1>

<p>On your terminal, it&rsquo;s quite hard to type them. the only reasonable
way is copying and pasting this character.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you are <strong>writing in vim</strong>, you should be able (by default)
to write utf-8 symbols in insert mode by pressing CTRL-V, yes <code>Ctrl</code>
and the letter <code>v</code>. Now you should be able to type <code>u</code> for unicode
and just write the unicode code for it. After you finish writing
the code, the character will appear on screen.</p>

<p>If it isn&rsquo;t appearing or you just see random whitespace, most likely
your terminal does not have the correct font installed or just neglects
that character.</p>

<a name="vim-example"></a>
<h2>vim example</h2>

<p>e.g. to write the capital letter E with a grave accent <code>È</code> you would do
the following. First, you&rsquo;d find that the code is <code>U+00C8</code>.
The hexadecimal code is <code>00c8</code>. Now you&rsquo;d go into vim, get into insert or
replace mode <a href="#references">₇</a>, then type <code>Ctrl-V</code>, then type <code>u</code>, then
type the hex code <code>00c8</code>. After typing it, the character should appear
on-screen in your terminal!</p>

<p>Cool!</p>

<p>Now, I should add that i found a vim plugin.</p>

<a name="vim-plugin"></a>

<p>so we now have a new domain !</p>

<p>unless you read the mediagoblin post, read this !</p>

<p>visit me now @ <a href="https://blog.thetrevor.tech">blog.thetrevor.tech</a>
to see my blog ! instead of the long kinda fishy domain <code>duckdns.org</code>.
Although it was a great start I now use <code>thetrevor.tech</code>.</p>

<p>I acquired it for a time of one year - for free btw. And the whole
domain is mine !</p>

<p>so yeah, I could write <code>thetrevor.thetrevor.tech</code> or literally
<code>mydomainforoneyear.thetrevor.tech</code> point is, I can now share
my site just as <code>thetrevor.tech</code> and they&rsquo;ll see the main page of
my site.</p>

<p>same as <a href="https://trevcan.duckdns.org/">https://trevcan.duckdns.org/</a></p>

<p>so yeah.</p>

<p>I got this through one of the github education offers with the <code>Dot-Tech</code>
domains company. By the way, I wasn&rsquo;t even able to change my account password.
This startup seems kinda fishy, but hey I got a free domain ! Their support
never answered me. the domain interface is weird and ultimately, I do need
<a href="https://duckdns.org">https://duckdns.org</a> since it&rsquo;s what anyone who accesses <a href="https://thetrevor.tech">https://thetrevor.tech</a> has to check
since in the DNS record <strong>is literally </strong> just an alias to <a href="https://trevcan.duckdns.org">https://trevcan.duckdns.org</a>.</p>

<p>And right now I don&rsquo;t want the hastle of setting up a nameserver system. Since
that&rsquo;s what <a href="https://trevcan.duckdns.org">https://trevcan.duckdns.org</a> is acting as! dot-tech provides some name-servers
which I could in theory use but I don&rsquo;t think they have an API to rapidly change my
<em>never-changing</em> ip addresses.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving some links below as well on some things that helped me set it up.</p>

<p>Also, you may now check my re-styled CSS <code>git</code> repo !<br>
now available @ <a href="https://git.thetrevor.tech">https://git.thetrevor.tech</a> !</p>

<p>Why do I sound like speaking broken english ! who know ? I don&rsquo;t speak like this, I hope.</p>

<a name="tldr"></a>
<h1>tldr</h1>

<ul>
<li>new domain: <code>thetrevor.tech</code></li>
<li><a href="https://thetrevor.tech">https://thetrevor.tech</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.thetrevor.tech">https://blog.thetrevor.tech</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.thetrevor.tech">https://git.thetrevor.tech</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I hope that by the end of this week I&rsquo;ll have a <code>videos.thetrevor.tech</code> set up so I can
upload any of my youtube videos to my computer and let anyone stream them from anywhere.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably be using peertube, it uses torrents, among other things; so I hope it doesn&rsquo;t
saturate my network.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll promote my blog, but I don&rsquo;t have any good ideas yet.</p>

<p>I also plan on explaining how I set up my website, from top to bottom; including my blog.</p>

<p>okay so bye.</p>

<p>Nothing new, I guess.</p>

<p>Why am I making this blog post ? Well, I&rsquo;m dumb.
No, I&rsquo;m not dumb. I&rsquo;m just trying to have an inner
conversation and some kind of introspection to understand
what is going on, man!</p>

<p>Why am I like this ??</p>

<p>Why do I self-sabotage ( is it with j or g ? oh yeah in
english it&rsquo;s definitely with <code>g</code>, right ? )  ??? !!!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t self-sabotage Hector!</p>

<p>You promised Tim that you&rsquo;d be good enough and work
on time. He has been nothing less than tolerant with you !
And that&rsquo;s a good thing. Seems like a nice guy.</p>

<p>Honestly, some people warned me that it could be a scam and
that I&rsquo;d be tutoring for free whilst he&rsquo;d be selling ads on
the discord chat or whatever. <strong> But it isn&rsquo;t a scam!! </strong></p>

<p>This person is real. He works a real job. Kinda boring, but
not boring to death. But he created this foundation that
helps highschool kids learn programming and also career-changing
adults to learn technology and get into coding jobs.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s good. And I&rsquo;ve met good people. Yet I have barely done
any work.</p>

<p>I promised Tim, I promised some friends I&rsquo;d do stuff; yet I haven&rsquo;t
done it !! Why, hector ?</p>

<p>Why are you still here ?!?! just writing this shit out on the
vim text editor which you think is cool because george hotz (a.k.a.
<code>geohot</code> or <code>t0mcr00se</code> ) talked about it <strong>ONCE</strong> on a recorded
live stream that you did not pay for and now I use it ! But it&rsquo;s
cool because I&rsquo;m a Linux guy, right ? I think I got into Linux because
of George, so thanks for that george. And george was also the guy
who introduced my to tiling window managers when I was first starting
out with Linux.</p>

<p>I tried out XMonad, actually.</p>

<p>But <strong>again</strong>, why the fuck am I still writing here !?!?!?!</p>

<p>Just get to work, man! don&rsquo;t try to get people&rsquo;s attention if you don&rsquo;t
deserve it.</p>

<p>No, fortunately I&rsquo;m not suicidal. Am I a pathological liar ? No, I
am a doer. Hector, you are a doer. You promise stuff.</p>

<p>When you don&rsquo;t achieve it, you should be honest with yourself and with
the people you promised it to. You should let them know that you&rsquo;re
a procrastinator - a professional procrastinator. Oh, God!
WHy would you even say that you are a <em>professional</em> procrastinator.?!?!?!?</p>

<p>What the hell does that even mean !? No, man. You are sabotaging yourself,
your relationships, your careeer.</p>

<p>Calm the fuck down, Hector.</p>

<p>Put your server on a fucking etc/hosts file and get over it !</p>

<p>Just to brag, this is my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file right now:</p>

<p><pre><code># Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1     localhost
127.0.0.1   t490-4rch.localdomain   t490-4rch   
0.0.0.0     news.ycombinator.com
0.0.0.0     lobste.rs
0.0.0.0     wikipedia.org
0.0.0.0     en.wikipedia.org
0.0.0.0     web.whatsapp.com
0.0.0.0     duckduckgo.com

</code></pre>
that is all. Maybe i&rsquo;ll add my server here after pushing this blog post
and just ignore it.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll try to as be zen as possible.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t even spell-check this shit, man.</p>

<p>Mistakes are made, and you probably aready know that I&rsquo;d have
corrected them or maybe I did not or ma8ybe I will.jjj1</p>

<p>Hello. I have recently acquired a domain for some time, called
&lsquo;thetrevor.tech&rsquo; and you may not visit my site using that
domain name.</p>

<p>e.g. <a href="https://blog.thetrevor.tech">https://blog.thetrevor.tech</a>. Yes, I kinda own the whole domain!
I now have a revamped git repo at <a href="https://git.thetrevor.tech">https://git.thetrevor.tech</a> !</p>

<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m getting very off-topic. For some time now I&rsquo;ve been
wanting to have a video streaming platform that allows you to
view videos from my server, without youtube or vimeo or peertube
or whatever. I found about peertube through Luke Smith&rsquo;s instance
in which he hosts some exclusive &ndash; yet still free - content.</p>

<p>Which sometimes forced me to instead go to that site instead of youtube
since sometimes he just won&rsquo;t altogether post any new videos on youtube
but will on peertube.</p>

<p>I also knew about odysee through Mental Outlaw. Not that mental outlaw
is bad or anything, but I don&rsquo;t like that much the decentralized
platform that consumes a ton of resources on your <strong>client</strong> web
browser and will just lag even on a moder web browser.</p>

<p>I like luke&rsquo;s peertube instance. It&rsquo;s fast and stable. even if it
uses webtorrent ! Plus, I can download the files and the
interface doesn&rsquo;t seem so bloated &ndash; although this may be just my bias
but whatever&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyways, I haven&rsquo;t even talked about the title of this blog post yet!
Have I now ?!</p>

<p>Ok, so the Mediagoblin deployment is not working on Arch Linux ?</p>

<p>Why ? because why not I guess.</p>

<p>But what is MediaGoblin ? Well, it is an attempt at making
an un-bloated self-hosted streaming video platform.</p>

<p>But it just won&rsquo;t install on Arch Linux. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I followed official guides on how to set this up yet it won&rsquo;t
work.</p>

<p>There are apparently documented issues that show that this is,
indeed, an issue specific to some Linux distributions and the
<code>autoconf</code> package! Why&hellip; and that&rsquo;s made by GNU! so get
ur stuff together, GNU!</p>

<p>this is the official bug report from the GNU Mediagoblin
issue tracker:</p>

<p><a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~mediagoblin/mediagoblin/12">https://todo.sr.ht/~mediagoblin/mediagoblin/12</a></p>

<p>ther useful links:</p>

</ul>


<p>So yeah. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try setting up peertube or something.</p>

<p>bored ?, read <a href="#references">[0]</a>.</p>

<a name="tldr"></a>
<h1>tldr</h1>

<p><code>convert FILE -resize SIZE OUT_FILE</code></p>

<p><code>convert image.jpeg -resize 300x new-image.jpeg</code></p>

<p>( resizes <code>image.jpeg</code> to <code>300x</code> width, scaling height accordingly
and writing it to <code>new-image.jpeg</code>)</p>

<p>Where <code>FILE</code> is the input image file you&rsquo;d like to resize,
<code>SIZE</code> is the new size in pixels, e.g. <code>500x</code> will set a
500x width and scale the height accordingly whilst keeping
the aspect ratio. And <code>OUT_FILE</code> is the output file. No,
it won&rsquo;t modify the original file.</p>

<p>That is all. oh, no. Dependencies!!</p>

<p>Yes, sometimes the truth hurts.</p>

<p>Especially if you have something to do with it.</p>

<p>Truth is weird. Humans lie. I try not to lie. I try to be
plainly honest most of the time. I try not to cheat on
exams. I try not to look at the exam answers even when my
friends would give them all to me without any academic
repercussions.</p>

<p>But when the truth affects your past, your situation,
your view of life. You kinda die inside. You oughtta accept
that sometimes you just aren&rsquo;t right and maybe you&rsquo;re
fucking wrong.</p>

<p>I fucked up, I guess. I think that you were definitely right,
Gaby. No problem. But it is hard accepting the truth.</p>

<p>End.</p>

<p>Hola, este es uno de mis primeros posts en español. Este es un texto originalmente publicado en <a href="#referencias">0</a>.</p>

<p>Decía Schopenahuer que una vez quedan resueltas todas las necesidades que la &ldquo;voluntad&rdquo; exige a las personas, a estas no les quedará más en la vida que el sinsentido, el desánimo, el ocio. La necesidad, el deseo de algo, es aquello que dota de propósito, rumbo y significado a nuestras existencias. Por ejemplo, si no sabes qué hacer con tu vida ten hijos y obtén un sentido para tu existencia, uno dado por default biológico.</p>

<p>Al mismo tiempo, filosofías como el budismo enseñan que estos deseos que la &ldquo;voluntad&rdquo; impone, pueden representar la cárcel de nuestras consciencias individuales.</p>

<p>El vagabundo y el despierto tienen algo en común: son seres marginados de los parámetros sociales; el propósito y significado de sus vidas es sobrevivir a la incertidumbre de encarar su propia existencia.</p>

<p>Es una cuestión de perspectivas: afronto el sinsentido de la realidad haciendo conscientes mis deseos animales, o bien, soy feliz con el breve goze que me brinde la satisfacción de mis necesidades y pulsiones, al igual que el traidor en Matrix elige los placeres de un mundo ficticio que despertar en la crudeza de una realidad que no le brinda satisfacciones externas.</p>

<p>Podríamos decir que la sociedad del siglo XXI ha resuelto sus necesidades básicas, al menos en la cultura de occidente, pero tal como indica la piramide de Maslow, hay luego otras necesidades tanto afectivas, de autoestima y autorrealización. ¿Vivimos en una sociedad que nos alienta a realizarnos y encontrarnos a nosotros mismos?</p>

<p>Creamos un mundo que enaltece la competitividad con otros seres humanos, que romantiza la meritocracia, al mismo tiempo la ansiedad y depresión han alcanzado picos tan altos que lo que consideramos una moda en realidad se trata de una epidemia. ¿Coincidencia? No lo creo.</p>

<p> Ya nuestras necesidades de simios salvajes están resueltas al punto que ahora llegamos a buscar la satisfacción del capricho, del simio vanidoso y las necesidades inventadas por el marketing. Ahora afrontamos de cara el vacío, la inseguridad de nuestros egos.
Ya no hay que salir a cazar ni ir a la guerra, ahora enfrentamos nuestra propia soledad frente a un mundo que no comprendemos, pero al que tratamos de adaptarnos desesperadamente mediante sus estándares de &ldquo;éxito&rdquo;.  Quizá por eso buscamos el mayor número de distracciones posibles, al igual que el citado traidor en Matrix, que le doten un sentido artificial a nuestra existencia: el placer, el aturdimiento de los sentidos.</p>

<p>Y todo este paradigma no es sino un nuevo mercado que explotar: el mercado del aburrimiento, del vacío existencial que busca satisfacerse con un iphone de miles de dólares; la avalancha de series, películas, videojuegos en las que olvidarnos por un día más.</p>

<p>Escrito por: no sé.</p>

<p>Netflix genre codes</p>

<p>The following explanation is in Spanish.
Should be pretty self explanatory even for non-Spanish speakers.</p>

<p>just replace the code in the urls for the ones you&rsquo;d like to search for.</p>

<p>Van a poner en la barra de búsqueda de su explorador
https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/
Después del “genre/” van a ingresar el código de la categoría que quieren ver, ejemplo:</p>

<p>“Steamy thrillers” o sea misterio cachondo el código es 972 ergo en su barra buscadora van a ingresar:
https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/972
Y ya ahí les va a salir un catálogo que incluye
-Basic Instinct
-Addicted
-Sliver, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Así que, si ustedes ya sabían y es noticia vieja, si ya los vimos, para los demás aquí va la lista de códigos.</p>

<p>Bonsoir, Elliot. <a href="#references">?</a></p>

<p>Donc, cet article c'est seulement un exercice ou je pratique mon
français, car je ne le veux pas perdre.</p>

<p>Probablemente ma prof le corrigera.</p>

<p>je ne sais pas qu'est-ce que je voudrais dire.</p>

<p>Je probablement doit dormir. J'éspère terminer cette article
demain. Au revoir</p>

<a name="references"></a>
<h1>references</h1>

<a name="r-c3--a9-ferences"></a>
<h1>réferences</h1>

<p>? : c'est une référence à une sérié de télévision appelé
Mr. Robot. Elle est une très bonne série Americaine, crée
par Sam Esmail et dirigé par lui-même. Ouais, j'ai fini
dejà la serié mais je le voudrais le re-voir quelques fois.
<strong>c'est pas pour enfants</strong>, sauf si tu le voulez générer
trauma. C'est aussi fort pour un adulte je pense. Elle
parle des thèmes qui peut-être tu ne voudrez pas penser.</p>

<p>I have a problem. I&rsquo;m a linux junkie. I&rsquo;d like to ssh into my
home-server from any network. This means networks that don&rsquo;t allow
port 22. My institution&rsquo;s network only allows port 80 and 443 (and
maybe vpn ports).</p>

<p>So I think what I need is a proxy server. A proxy is what is sounds
like. It&rsquo;s an intermediary between me and the target server. But
it can work through http and use other protocols (in theory).</p>

<p>just about four minutes ago I stumbled upon a good friend of mine, Nacho. He was with her friend, Betzabé. I couldn&rsquo;t remember the name. Nor did she remember mine. So we did not salute. Then Cindy arrived. I did remember Cindy&rsquo;s name. Then I asked them about where the <em>Auditorium 1</em> was. Apparently I had fucked up. It was in the high school building, not in undergrad. Then I told Betzabe hello, and sincerely said that I couldn&rsquo;t remember her name. &ldquo;Betzabé&rdquo;, she told me. She confessed she didn&rsquo;t remember mine either.</p>

<p>So this story / blog post shall be meant to be used for future reference when trying to remember Betzabè&rsquo;s name. Betzabé. <em>Betzabé</em>. <strong>Betzabé</strong>. <strong><em>Betzabé</em></strong>. Her name is Betzabé. Almost all of the times I&rsquo;ve encountered Nacho I&rsquo;ve also encountered with Betzabé. Weird name. Three syllables. or Betza, maybe ? Nah, I&rsquo;ll confuse her with someone who&rsquo;s actually referred to as Betza. Are you though ? Are you referred to as Betza, Betzabé ?</p>

<p>Who knows, lol. Just a fun story I felt like writing I guess. Back to the
<code>always-late-cause-we're-inmexico-and-stuff.</code></p>

<p>Bye.</p>

<p>Other names I&rsquo;ve sometimes forgotten:</p>

<ul>
<li>Victoria</li>
</ul>

<p>notes de ma classe de philosophie.</p>

<p>la réalité, la nature et ce que se trouve plus loin des les choses.</p>

<p>La metaphysique ne parle pas de fantomes, spirite, etc.</p>

<p>Elle parle de ce que se trouve plus de notre réalités et pour
quoi est qu'on pense qu'il est.</p>

<p>Chacun de nos est en changeant vraiment.</p>

<p>Le seule chose permanent est le change.</p>

<p>C'est ça.</p>

<p>Pour quoi est-ce qu'on s'appelle le même après beaucoups des annés ?
<code>Car il est socialment indagé je pense, ou même si indoctriné, no ?</code></p>

<blockquote><p>La nature humaine est très faible,<br>
mais elle est un nature qui est consciente,<br>
consicente de sa propre faibilité.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, as of yesterday I was running a git over ssh server.
Which isn&rsquo;t even a server <em>per se</em>, since it just runs
software that was already installed on my system. (<code>ssh</code>)</p>

<p>But this approach isn&rsquo;t very useful. It does not allow
me to update my git repositories (including
my blog) through restricted networks, such
as the institution I study at. Port 22 is indeed
restricted.</p>

<p>So I thought, I&rsquo;ve always seen that https/ssh/zip button
link thing on github. Why can&rsquo;t I do that ? Isn&rsquo;t https
like allowed on almost any network ? So I started investigating.</p>

<p>According to the git-scm [0] reference manual, there are other
ways to host servers. One of them is using a CGI script that
runs server-side.</p>

<p><code>CGI</code> stands for <em>Common Gateway Interface</em>.
It&rsquo;s a standard protocol that is
to be run server-side to provide HTTP content on-demand.
Most popular webservers will provide plugins to run CGI scripts. This protocol takes a few environment variables and just returns the HTTP response just as if it were a server. In the future, I&rsquo;d love to make my own &lsquo;CGI Server&rsquo;.</p>

<hr />

<p>So I tried to set up my lighttpd web server to route all requests
for the domain <code>https://git-push.thetrevor.tech/</code> to the CGI script.</p>

<p>I must say, this was a pain in the ass, but this is my working configuration
file.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-trevcan.duckdns.org/lighttpd-conf.git/tree/sites-enabled/push-git.conf">https://git-trevcan.duckdns.org/lighttpd-conf.git/tree/sites-enabled/push-git.conf</a></p>

<p>when i have the time i&rsquo;ll explain it over.</p>

<p>please don&rsquo;t hack me.</p>

<p>On windows 10, when ejecting a hard disk drive, it will stop
spinning. That is nice. It, of course, unmounts the partitions
before.</p>

<p>Linux does not do this automatically, at least not my minimalist
setup that only uses <code>dmenu</code>,<code>lsblk</code>,<code>mount</code>,<code>umount</code> and a little
of <code>grep</code>/<code>sed</code>/<code>other text-editing tools</code>.</p>

<p>When unmounting a drive using <code>umount</code> it merely unmounts the disk
partitions. It DOES NOT manage power, as far as I know.</p>

<p>To remove power from the HDD, I use a tool named <code>hdparm</code>, used to
set HDD parameters through the shell. The package should
be installed by default on
<a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/hdparm/">archlinux</a>,
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hdparm/">this is the project page</a>
(it has adware).</p>

<p>Anyways, to set the HDD params you need to be root. I don&rsquo;t know how
to set the permissions so that a normal user can do this, but I&rsquo;m not
interested in learning how to do that cause if an attacker gains
command execution on my system I don&rsquo;t want them to have access to
managing my HDDs power.</p>

<p>I use this script:</p>

<p><pre><code>    timeout 10s prompt "Remove power from $1 ? " "sudo -A hdparm -Y $1" &amp;&amp;
    notify-send "$ dmenuumount" "Power removed from ${1}. You may disconnect it now."
</code></pre>
the important part is <code>hdparm -Y "$1"</code>. This flag <code>-Y</code> (yes, capital Y) means
put the device in the
lowest possible power mode. It will still be listed under <code>lsblk</code> but it will turn
on once you actually want to mount it. the <code>"$1"</code> is the path for the device, e.g.
<code>/dev/sde</code>.</p>

<p>As noted before, you must be root.
<strong>BE SURE to check the device, since running this </strong>
<strong>command on any devices you are using could fuck up the system!</strong></p>

<p>questions ? <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me.</p>

<p>based on this article: <a href="https://www.linuxshelltips.com/find-and-delete-empty-directories-in-linux/">https://www.linuxshelltips.com/find-and-delete-empty-directories-in-linux/</a></p>

<p>Problem is: I have a linux shell script that lets me mount hard drives,
usb, and other storage devices. But if I have already mounted
some storage device and it has a lot of folders, my command will
keep looking for empty folders where other storage devices can
be mounted. In other words, I have a directory <code>/media/</code> where all
the folders for external devices are created. I mount my big HDD
with a ton of folders to - let&rsquo;s say - <code>/media/HDD_0</code>. Now it is
available and there are thousands upon thousands of files available
under <code>/media/HDD_0</code>. Now I want to mount <strong>another</strong> device. What
my script does if find empty folders under <code>/media/</code> but it will
find it recursively.</p>

<p>So the solution is using the <code>-maxdepth n</code> option for the <code>find</code> command.
This allows you to set a maximum depth in which to look. Pretty
self-explanatory, right ? So in other words, if I give <code>find</code> a
starting point of <code>/media/</code> it won&rsquo;t go more than <code>n</code> folders
recursively. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Yeah, I use the <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice">LARBS voidrice</a>
<code>dmenumount</code> script, apparently the github does have a max-depth but I
think I removed that because I only wanted to look under <code>/media/</code>.</p>

<p>But hey, I fixed it with the magic of the internet and reading man-pages
and at times bashing my head at my own hands or arms.</p>

<p>written on march 29th</p>

<p>I am addicted to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a></p>

<p>Or maybe I am just too much of an asshole to want to talk to my friends.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything to say. I&rsquo;ve recoursed back into using my phone
more often, and <em>not</em> leaving it behing. I used to leave it behind
when going to the bathroom, for a walk or just for anything, actually.</p>

<p>Yet today I was very worried. I really liked someone, I told her that
I liked her but she was in shock. I didn&rsquo;t see her again until like
four hours later. I tried to talk to her but I guess she didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<p>So yeah, she does not like me. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Anyways, that has somewhat something to do with the black points over
the orange background. Yes, I am referring to hacker news. Specifically,
the points I have accumulated on my profile [0].</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that I do not enjoy reading the orange news anymore. Every
once in a while - more like a shit-more often than before - I&rsquo;ve clicked
on the new section of news. Meaning, even news aren&rsquo;t &lsquo;that&rsquo; ranked but they
appear almost as they are submitted by users all around the globe.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t even find the normal hacker news ranked content nor the show
nor the ask nor the newest news hacker news relevant to me anymore.
Yet I check and check and check and check and check.</p>

<p>A few interesting articles here and there, but I don&rsquo;t finish them. They kinda
bore me to death.</p>

<p>Fortunately, my relationship with that person I was talking about is fine,
but yeah she&rsquo;s told me that I am not liked by her. But she&rsquo;s a very good
person and by no means I would like to ruin our friendship. You are a good
friend Astrid. You too Fatima, for reading my blog and being there and
teaching me chinese.</p>

<p>拜拜</p>

<p>I hope that means bye.</p>

<p>After reading one of the top posts on Ask HN this day, I stumbled upon this
blog search engine, known as <a href="https://blogsurf.io/">blogsurf</a>. It&rsquo;s a blog
search engine.</p>

<p>Small community. 200 blogs ! oh my god, that&rsquo;s nothing! Anyways, eventually
I saw one of the top blogs
and stumbled upon <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/">waitbutwhy.com</a>.</p>

<p>The articles seem promising, I read a couple but got to the middle of
each one and then left. Eventually, I clicked on the &lsquo;about&rsquo; page and started
reading the &lsquo;wait but who&rsquo;. Very meta web-site. This about page acknowledges
the hurdles of maintaining a website whilst working a (maybe?) full-time job.</p>

<p>3 members apparently. They seem funny.</p>

<p>Some articles that I think seem promising but I actually haven&rsquo;t read:
- <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/cant-post-on-time.html">why i can&rsquo;t post on time</a>
- <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html">religion for the non-religious</a>
- and of course, the funny faq page: <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/faq">faq</a></p>

<p><em>yes, even for root!</em></p>

<p>Main reason this happens is usually the permissions themselves.</p>

<p>If you ain&rsquo;t root you won&rsquo;t be able to change an external hard
drive mounted <strong>without custom</strong> permissions.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR; become r00t (root) !</strong></p>

<p><strong>TLDR 2; or just RTFM and man tf outta mount!</strong></p>

<p><pre><code>man mount
</code></pre>
</p>

<a name="wait-2c--you-didn-27-T-solve-my-PROBLEM-21--21-"></a>
<h1>wait, you didn&rsquo;T solve my PROBLEM!!</h1>

<p>well, then, you are in some luck. You probably have a file
system that doesn&rsquo;t allow permissions. These file systems
include fat, vfat, fat32, and others. These file systems
may complain when trying to change permissions, so just
chown the root directory in which your external storage
device is mounted at and you&rsquo;ll probably be good to go in
order to add files without being root.</p>

<p>That is all. Thanks for reading my ted talk.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: there&rsquo;s swearing and sensitive topics (including suicide)</em> dont kill yourself</p>

<p>You, Hector from the future. do not die. do not willingly kill yourself. why did you not win ? you asshole, man!</p>

<p>You really fucked up by not uploading those extra bytes of code. didn&rsquo;t ya ? or was it because of the f'ed up corruption.</p>

<p>Point is, <strong>Hector</strong>, if you are ever trying to kikk yourself, do not do it. Don&rsquo;t do it for Alex, Alex, Joe, Amilcar, Astrid, Gaby, or Jenny. <strong>Do it for your fucking self, you asshole.</strong></p>

<p>You are a human being.
the fact that you are still here says a lot:
You are more important than someone or something else.
You are here because you survive.
You overcome.
You adapt.</p>

<p>Fuck me, man. Fuck me hard.
fuck duck. dick duck duck go.
good thing the IT guys at my school
blocked my blog, they won&rsquo;t
be hearing my swearing any time
soon.</p>

<p>fucking referees and FTAs. someone did this.</p>

<p>had to be done. same thing happened when that alliance was with another team. 2 robots being
disconnected, from same alliance.</p>

<p>yet the refs/ftas did presque shit-nothing even we told them so.</p>

<p>we supposedly lost comms. more like
someone might have installed some RF interferrer to fuck with us.</p>

<p>kill me, man. No, don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I want to date Astrid, and I will.</p>

<p>I am going to.</p>

<p>context: go to end of document.</p>

<p>Hello. I woke up several times and tried to sleep and turned off my shitty alarms.</p>

<p>Eventually, Joe called. I answered. I understood, my voice was clearly fucked up.
I think I&rsquo;m dehydrated.</p>

<p>Then an alarm started to sound at the same time I was taking the phone call !
What a silly design choice, Apple ! Then I woke up,
went to the bathroom, tried not to die.</p>

<p>I then started committing a lot of changes. Then I pushed. And I pushed.</p>

<p>I got 500'ed by github. What a shame. Github is my go-to remote git provider.
It works over https, aka firewalls don&rsquo;t tell me no. I had some respect for Github.</p>

<p>But I had to push this as fast as I could. So I ssh'ed into my home server,
then created a bare git repo and pushed to that.</p>

<p>Since my friend is in a proxy plus firewalle&rsquo;d network, he couldn&rsquo;t use his ssh keys
so I sent him a link to this:</p>

<p><pre><code>https://git.trevcan.duckdns.org/RobotCode_2022.git/
</code></pre>
And that works over https ! Push doesn&rsquo;t work over http/(s) but yeah. He was
able to pull in no time and could get my code. So that&rsquo;s good I guess.</p>

<p>[0]:  speed running today&rsquo;s [blog]. I should probably eat now, it&rsquo;s 10:30 in the
morning and I haven&rsquo;t attended any of my high school courses. I should go to
tecbot.</p>

<p>Ok, bye</p>

<p>Yesterday - well, technically the day before yesterday a.k.a. <em>antier</em> in Spanish -
me and some friends were sharing stories of how we got into Tecbot, the
robotics team I am a member of. We were
tired after a long day of working, testing the robot; building stuff; realizing
that X or Y doesn&rsquo;t work; trying to find x or y thing for this problem; then
realizing again that it was there the whole time behind some backpacks or whatever.</p>

<p>Anyways, we got to this kid. His name is Velasco. He is in 2nd semester of high
school. In other words, he&rsquo;s a freshman. He tried to get into tecbot since
middle school, in 9th grade. People
referred him to X teacher. Teacher did not respond his emails. None. Nada. none
at all. Maybe his institutional teacher account had some corporate spam
email filters so maybe he never actually received it ! So he got tired and
eventually got into the high school were the robotics team was.</p>

<p>But this was all during the pandemic so he barely got to be in the
high school buildings.</p>

<p>He tried emailing him again. And again. He seemed busy. He did not respond.
Yet Santiago figured out the name of the teacher, then ( somehow ) got his
zoom handle and started to get into his meetings at random times.</p>

<p>Eventually he figured out at which times he had to give classes and at
which times he actually gave Tecbot. The head coach, X, is more like the
manager. He knows some things here and there, I think he&rsquo;s an engineer
but hasn&rsquo;t practiced in a long time. He isn&rsquo;t actually one of the mentors
giving technical advice - well, sometimes he actually <strong>is</strong>. So Velasco
eventually figured out who the mentors were - that&rsquo;s what we call them -
and started to take electrical courses. This includes from resistance,
raw formulas to actual real wiring of the robot, soddering, managing
batteries, cables, and a shit-load of other things.</p>

<p>For this Velasco, I admire you. I somewhat remember when I got into
tecbot. But I don&rsquo;t think it was this hard for me. I actually tried
getting into tecbot at the same age as you did - when I was in 9th
grade. But it wasn&rsquo;t this hard. My best friend had a brother who
was attending that high school and that robotics team. He was - at
the time - the season driver ! So yeah, I was able to get in
pretty easily. But I very much appreciate that you are now in
the team.</p>

<p>You told us and made us realize that showing up and doing things
is more important than being on a list. There was never and will
never be any list. If you have enough dedication to go through
all this and more, you can and will and are going to be able
to do anything you want.</p>

<p>This post is for you,</p>

<p>Velasco.</p>

<p>It works like a VPN, acts like a VPN, feels like a VPN; but it kinda
isn&rsquo;t a VPN.</p>

<p>Would you like to access your local network ?</p>

<p>Are you too lazy to set up a real VPN server like me ? Do
you like security ? Well, now you can use a virtual private
network through ssh and route all requests from one machine to
another, using <a href="https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle">sshuttle</a>.</p>

<a name="tldr"></a>
<h1>tldr</h1>

<p>commands:</p>

<p><pre><code>sshuttle -x server.org -r user@server.org 0.0.0.0/0 --dns
sshuttle -x server.org -r user@server.org addresses/subnet --dns
</code></pre>
WHERE:</p>

<p><code>server.org</code> is your (ssh-enabled) server&rsquo;s domain name.</p>

<p><code>-x server.org</code> means, exclude the <code>server.org</code> domain from being routed
through your server (<code>server.org</code>), the wiki says some problems occur on some
linux machines - it will recursively resolve to itself and the ssh session
will crash.</p>

<p>use <code>0.0.0.0</code> on <code>SUBNET</code> to route ALL requests through ssh server.</p>

<p>use <code>24</code> for <code>subnet</code> and use <code>192.168.1.0</code> on <code>addresses</code> to route requests starting with <code>192.168.1.</code> through the ssh server.</p>

<p>e.g. <code>sshuttle --dns -x server.org -r user@server.org 192.168.1.0/24</code></p>

<p>not a real article, just a list of links.</p>

<p>Might do a writing on this some day.</p>

<p>You can view my simple webserver in C @
<a href="https://trevcan.duckdns.org/short">https://trevcan.duckdns.org/short</a>
all requests with at least that are passed from lighttpd to the webserver.</p>

<p>I coded in something to show you the headers your browser is sending:

<p>Shame on me. Shame on my team. I lead the software team @ tecbot. Includes
programming.</p>

<p>Pneumatics did not work. The compressor would not turn on.</p>

<p>We did not have any good solenoids to test it on.</p>

<p>Guess the culprit. Me, myself, and I.</p>

<p>I never created a solenoid object. If I don&rsquo;t use pneumatics, the
thread to keep the compressor at the necessary pressure will never start.</p>

<p>AAAHHHHhhhh! shame on me ! shame on wpilib ! how dare you guys code
that in ?</p>

<h1>bug</h1>

<p>you run <code>sudo pacman -Syu</code>, but then you get an error
<strong>Key is marginal trust or whatever.</strong></p>

<p>solution:</p>

<a name="TLDR:"></a>
<h1>TLDR:</h1>

<p><pre><code># pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring &amp;&amp; pacman -Su
</code></pre>
(assumes root)</p>

<p>See this Arch Post: <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=267364">https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=267364</a></p>

<p><code>Key is marginal trust or whatever.</code></p>

<p>Actually, RTFM! (me included lol). It&rsquo;s actually documented in the arch wiki:

<p>Hello there. I use spotify. My dad pays for it.</p>

<p>It allows me to listen to almost any popular artists and songs, even indie
creators are there to! I do not use the podcast features.</p>

<p>I doubt that I have found &lsquo;good&rsquo; songs through Spotify ? But I might
be wrong. My <em>liked songs</em> playlist is like 215 songs long, not bad I guess.</p>

<p>But yeah, a lot of consumption. Remember what happened to spotify like
less than a week ago ? Well, let me remind you.
Spotify servers went down for whatever reason.</p>

<p>You open the app, your phone is connected to the internet. You want to
listen to some <strong>downloaded</strong> songs. The app pings the auth server, doesn&rsquo;t
respond; logs you out. You are now unable to access any of your spotify music.</p>

<p><strong>YOUR</strong>. Yours? Your music? Really yours ? doesn&rsquo;t sound like it.
You weren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong. You are a paying customer who gives
them money on a monthly basis through a platform that allows you to download
songs and audio. But restricted. You were not pirating anything. Yet you
were gated by the same company who built the software.</p>

<p>Were the devs instructed to do this ? I certainly hope not. And if they did
that on purpose, with all due respect, shame on you !</p>

<p>Ok, so enough backstory I guess.</p>

<p>For a while now I&rsquo;ve been wanting to make myself more independent from software
I use. So I though about downloading all the music I have saved on spotify.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t easily download them from Spotify and decrypt them. Or maybe yes ? If
so, please <a href="https://blog.trevcan.duckdns.org/contact.html">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways, I eventually found some services which charge you for using the spotify
api to retrieve a list of all your playlists. But then I appended &lsquo;github&rsquo;
to my search query and lo and behold, we have
<a href="https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify/">exportify</a>!. It&rsquo;s an open source free
project that allows you to export any of your playlists, either imported or
created by you! You can export all of them in bulk, or one by one if you prefer.</p>

<p>All the code runs &lsquo;in the browser&rsquo;, at least according to the git readme.</p>

<p>It is served &lsquo;statically&rsquo;[0] through github pages @
<a href="https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/">https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/</a>.</p>

<p>the website needs javascript and an internet connection for it to work.
It will connect to the spotify api.</p>

<p>Ok, so then I exported all of them, unzipped them.</p>

<p>CSVs. hmmm. comma-separated values. simple enough I guess. With a shit-load
of boring spotify links and the title and artist. All I need.</p>

<p>Song title, song artist. That&rsquo;s it. After a few makefiles, some rambling
around with zsh and bashisms and weird shell syntax, I got awk and tr
to work for me.</p>

<p>todo: add makefile here or somewhere</p>

<p>Ok, so once I got all my playlist songs, I converted each of them to
whatever I wanted.</p>

<p>Then I used yt-dlp (fork) to download the videos by appending the artist
name to the song, and using its own search engine to query from youtube.</p>

<p>so the code looked like this:</p>

<p><pre><code>yt-dlp --default-search ytsearch: "$SEARCH_QUERY"
</code></pre>
and I did that for each song.
And i added a couple flags here and there to tell it I want aac files and
metadata about the songs/videos.</p>

<p>It took hours. Mainly because youtube detected that I was downloading
a shit-load of youtube videos and it wasn&rsquo;t normal.</p>

<p>Sometimes downloads were around 10 MB/s (yes, megabytes) but then they
circled down to maybe 700 kB/s or so. The popular songs were the ones
that got stalled.</p>

<p>The total size of all my songs and saved playlists on spotify was about
20 GB. Then I targzipped the shit out of it and got 18GB. Still a lot.</p>

<p>This was in the morning. I went to school. I couldn&rsquo;t use up 20 GB
out of my cell phone data carrier! Plus, the speed would be shit.</p>

<p>So I had to figure out a way to download it through my institution&rsquo;s
internet connection. Web server. I have a web server, a blog, and some
other stuff. I have directory listing enabled in some places. Yay.</p>

<p>I logged into my web server through ssh using my cellular data -
because my university has the port 22 blocked and won&rsquo;t allow me to
ssh into my server - and proceeded to move the tar file
to a place where it could be showed by the web server, publically.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to sue me. Just know that this falls under
personal use and no, I am not profiting from downloading these songs.</p>

<p>I am still paying for the same services I was paying before.
Please don&rsquo;t sue me.</p>

<p>Anyways, the tar.gz file was public and now was my computer&rsquo;s time
to shine. I&rsquo;m on Linux and the download speed are incredibly good
on my uni&rsquo;s internet. When I&rsquo;m on windows 10 they appear to be
stalled for some reason ! No, I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>

<p>Well, maybe because the servers for the school run linux or something.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Point is, I started a wget command of the tar.gz file,
I got a stable 10 MB/s, going up to 15 at times.
wget said it would be done in about 2 hours. I was in my car. This was
perfect.</p>

<p>Then I guess a sysadmin caught me or something. A stable connection to
a server with around 10 MB/s for more than 10 minutes ? I was over https,
so I guess they didn&rsquo;t catch whatever I was downloading. So they
started to stall the download. wget showed literally &mdash; where the speed
was. Actually, it first started slowing it down to maybe 8, then 7, then
six and five and four and three and one and two MB/s. Then to the 50x KB/s,
wow. sometimes it didn&rsquo;t respond at all. Other websites worked fine
through a web browser. Speed was fine. It was probably a sysadmin blocking
my connection. I cancelled the download. I restarted it. Same problem.</p>

<p>So I started capping my download speed to 2 MB/s through wget. Fair enough.
Other people have more important things to do with these glorious internet
that sometimes gives a 300 ping on websites, but sometimes just a couple of
milliseconds! so I capped it. And the sysadmin or network guy
or automated program kept stalling my download ! To like 300, then 500
KB/s. It was like a cat and mouse game. I was at 2 MB/s for a stable minute,
they got catch of it. Started to lower it to 1.5, 1, then 500 KB/s or just
stall it completely. But it was basically oscillating between 500 KB/s and
2 MB/s. Constantly, so yeah.</p>

<p>By that time, I was at lunch. Then I went out and left my computer downloading
the file with my friends. Eventually the computer started to complain.</p>

<p>It was almost out of battery. I was not there. It had less than ten percent
and it was beeping, I programmed it to do that. Thankfully. My friends
started asking questions to my computer as if it were a human being.</p>

<p>All my computer did was beep, beep, and beep. The beep was consistent.
I laughed at the story when I arrived. If I had arrived maybe 15 minutes later,
it would have reached 0 and would be dead. Actually, my Lenovo T490 <em>kills</em>
itself like at 2% and does not allow you to turn it on. Well, it turns on
at 2% but like 5 seconds later it dies. So I was kinda just in time to charge
it. So I went inside, to the <a href="http://team3158.tech/">tecbot workshop</a>
to charge my computer. I brought my backpack with me, as my charger was there.</p>

<p>Computer still not dead. Started charging it, all good.</p>

<p>then I went back to eat with my friends on some benches.</p>

<p>In total, I&rsquo;d say the download took around five hours. Maybe six
with the first download. I reached like 15-20 % in the first one! I don&rsquo;t know
why I stopped it and started re-downloading it again.</p>

<p>So yeah, 18 GB of targzipped tarballed music. Started de-compressing it.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have enough space. I cancelled it. I connected my hard disk drive.</p>

<p>three tera-bytes. nice. I copied the tarball there and started decompressing.</p>

<p>It did take a while, maybe ten minutes at most I&rsquo;d say. Not bad I guess.</p>

<p>After that, I had shit-loads of music. But at the time of writing this,</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t even put all the music onto a USB. i don&rsquo;t think I have another one
big enough for 18 GB worth of a lot of music. I could plug in
my hard drive. But the partition where I saved it at is ext4. I doubt the
volvo I drive will be able to read that. Plus, I don&rsquo;t want to fuck the HDD up.
Constant turning on and off, probably the disk spinners are not properly set
to &lsquo;power saving&rsquo; mode when turning off the car. So no thanks. Maybe I&rsquo;ll use the
usb I have for operating systems. 32 GB. probably less usable storage. whatever.</p>

<p>I have an 8 gb spare usb, maybe I&rsquo;ll transfer the most important oses to it.</p>

<p>Ok, so now I have a shitload of music. I feel proud of myself.</p>

<p>I can even browse it through directory listing using http(<em>s</em>! included but not enforced!)
but it won&rsquo;t autoplay.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll look into creating a .pls file or a .m3u8 file for playlists. They allow
for absolute paths, not necessarily a server audio stream. so yeah, I should make some
code for that.</p>

<p>Also, the volvo I use does not allow a lot of media formats. It does accept mp3, but
I didn&rsquo;t have that. yt-dlp downloaded everything in opus, the first time I did tests.</p>

<p>Plus, the usb needs to be in fat32. I reformatted the 8gb usb just in case - it was
already fat32. Then i copied some of the songs I had downloaded on my computer. Before
the big &lsquo;all playlists&rsquo; operation. But yeah, did not work the first time due to
audio file types. All were in opus. So i converted them to mp3s or something and
it worked.</p>

<p>[0] I say statically in quotes because I tried copying the html to my computer and
    it didn&rsquo;t work. I got some error when trying to get the spotify token
    and setting up the spotify auth, apart from the fact that the html paths
    for the scripts and css were absolute, so I had to change them manually.</p>

<p>Bonjour, ç'est seulement un petit blog post
où j'essaie de parler français et en vérifiant
que le système autonome fonctionne. Le suivants mots
montreront un peux de comme fonctionne le système pour
faire le blog possible.</p>

<p>Je suis un peux ennuyé et enfadé des systèmes,
articles, blogs qui utilise espàce comme s'il était libre.
Presque toutes les sites web que je visite son très, très
<em>bloated</em> ( saturés ) et ils ont beaucoup de choses qui n'aident pas à
la lecture du site, l'absorption d'information ou la
transference d'idées.</p>

<p>Je doit faire un travail d'école donc je continuera,
peut-être que demain.</p>

<p>This guide is a tutorial to learn how to import ( and optionally delete) and browse your pictures and videos inside your iOS Device. You only need a working computer, a lightning-to-usb (with data transfer) cable, and an iOS device.</p>

<a name="non-2d-features"></a>
<h3>non-features</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>You do not need another, external iOS Device, you do not need to pay Apple for iCloud, you do not need to download laggy, iTunes windows-and-mac only software.</strong></li>
</ul>


<a name="features"></a>
<h3>features</h3>

<ul>
<li>you can browse all pictures and videos saved in your iOS Device</li>
<li>you can delete any pictures on said iOS Device</li>
<li>you can copy all the pictures easily.</li>
<li>you can do this from a Linux / GNU + Linux / *NIX machine.</li>
</ul>


<p>the software used will be <a href="https://libimobiledevice.org/">libimobiledevice</a>, a cross-platform software library used to communicate to iOS devices. <a href="https://libimobiledevice.org/#get-started">ifuse</a> shall also be used to enable filesystem mounting.</p>

<a name="start"></a>
<h1>start</h1>

<ol>
<li>connect iOS device. Click allow for computer pop-up thing.</li>
</ol>


<p>assuming usbmuxd service is active,
use the idevicepair command to connect to your device:
<pre><code>$ idevicepair pair
</code></pre>
yeah, the command argument seems redundant. You should get some
&lsquo;SUCESS: Paired with &rsquo;
and a long string of characters.</p>

<ol>
<li>mount filesystem.</li>
</ol>


<p>assuming you have ifuse installed,
use this command:</p>

<p><pre><code># ifuse -o allow_other MOUNTPOINT
</code></pre>
where mountpoint is an existing directory.</p>

<ol>
<li>Access. Access your mountpoint.
Keep in mind user permissions,
you may have to chmod the directory
beforehand to be able to gain
access as a non-root user.</li>
</ol>


<p>now you can enter the file system.</p>

<p>You should get a lot of folders
when browsing the root dir.</p>

<p>The important folder is DCIM.</p>

<p>all pictures are there. <strong>Careful!</strong></p>

<p>You can write to this folder.</p>

<a name="delete-photos"></a>
<h1>delete photos</h1>

<p>If you want to delete the pictures just
do an rm -rf of the *APPLE folders
under DCIM. Careful!</p>

<p>Pictures will still be cached in
the device, so you&rsquo;ll need to cause
a database rebuild of your camera
roll:</p>

<p><pre><code># cd &lt;mountpoint&gt;/PhotoData
# rm Photos* com.apple.photos.caches_metadata.plist
</code></pre>
that&rsquo;s it. you can also browse your
ringtones, there&rsquo;s a folder.</p>

<p>you can also write to it, but I haven&rsquo;t found a way to let new ringtones appear in the list.</p>

<p>Right now what I do is generate a new one from garageband, choose a name,
then import it. connect device. copy m3u ringtone to the dir and change its name to one of the custom ringtones. that works.</p>

<a name="files-3f-"></a>
<h1>files?</h1>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t found a way to access
the &lsquo;files&rsquo; within the iOS File Manager. For now, I use this thing called &lsquo;snapdrop&rsquo; to serve over LAN a couple files here and there.</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s it! Something you want to add
or critique ? Go ahead and <a href="https://trevcan.duckdns.org/blog/contact.html">contact</a> me!</p>

<p>Chanson de Pomplamoose.</p>

<p>Voyez la vidéo ici: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoDjLmFcTCg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoDjLmFcTCg</a></p>

<p>Cette chanson est grammatiquement correct, mais elle parle
d'amour et comme la rélation entre une couple peut se
tuer par des autres factores comme le travail, ses amies
et en géneral distractions.</p>

<p>making this because sometimes i don&rsquo;t RTFM.</p>

<p><strong>Assuming you use the Network Manager daemon to manager network connections, follow
this procedure:</strong></p>

<p>go to this path: as root
<pre><code>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
</code></pre>
Then try listing the directory with ls. you should see
a list of *.nmconnection files.</p>

<p>open the files and there will be the password and auth specific stuff.</p>

2023: Wendy's Crew. 6 weeks. Summer job.
    I worked a summer job at a Wendy's in Flower Mound, Texas.
    I worked the front, taking orders from customers, dispatched orders
    to the drive-thru and the front, made fries, served drinks, washed
    dishes, cleaned the store and the fry station. Lots of team work
    and communication to manage multiple orders at the same time.

2022 : two and a half months. Remote. Paid internship. Junior developer.
    @ wiringbits [9]
    I was hired as a junior developer. I worked on learning about the Scala
    programming language, functional paradigms plus OOP. I then started
    fixing bugs here and there in their opensource project &lt;cazadescuentos.net&gt;,
    an online web store scraper.
    I submitted Pull Requests to the project, worked on feedback from 
    coworkers and asked for advice when having doubts.
    
2019 - present: Learned Linux ! 
    also sysadmin stuff. 
    Set up a lighttpd web server.
                
    all my website and blog [3],[4],
                
    are hosted on an old computer connected to my home
    internet modem. 

    The computer runs Arch Linux and  its longest
    uptime has been 80d, 12h, 17m and counting !
    see for yourself!: [6]

    I use a dynamic DNS provider to set it up. Of course,
    
    I set up port forwarding to be able to set up the site
        over HTTP and HTTPS. Also set up SSH, among a few other ports.

    Also deployed cgit [5], a CGI web interface for viewing
    interactively and diffing different commits and projects.

    I also set up a git over HTTPs repository, on my own. Ton of work,
    web server configuration ain't easy at all!

    I'd love to set up my own peertube or odyssee instance but
    I've failed to do it. I also tried MediaGoblin but 
    containers are certainly hard ! Will update here if I get it
    working.

    
2022: Final Project for Advanced Programming High school class.
    We implemented a web application (CRUD), using XAMPP,
    allowing us to update and register
    exam evaluations. 
    Collaborative project (2 developers),
    There were data checks performed through javascript,
    then it would submit a form and PHP would register
    it to a MySQL database.
    Github Project: [2]
    
2021: (2 weeks) Cyber Security Externship at WorkED. 
    Done virtually due to pandemic. 
    Learned about frameworks to make reports and main
    strategies to combat bad actors.
    Worked with real pen-testing tools, Linux, learned about SQL injections.
    Talked to several cybersecurity experts in 
    several fields (private, public).
    Worked with rangeforce platform (&lt;https://rangeforce.com&gt;).
    Made professional reports about previous 
    vulnerabilities, worked in teams, made new relationships.

    
    
    
2018 August - 2022 August: Member of TECBOT Robotics Team. 
    Competes against other 
    highschools, national and international in FRC (First Robotics Competition). 
    Member of the software 
    team and have led the teaching of new students who learn 
    Java Programming for FRC. 
    Our code is on github: [0].
    See also: Our Code for the 2022 FRC Season: [8]
    Tecbot website: [1].



2019: Workshop: •The Science Behind Technological Design: A 
    Human-Centered Approach. 
    With Monica Perusquia as instructor.
    1 week. Undergrad and high school (me) students. 
    First time I installed Linux (Ubuntu) ! Got me very interested.
    Learned Linux, teamwork, reading software documentation, 
    tried out python with some ML. 
    We made a prototype to measure a person's posture + stress 
    + haptic feedback.
            
2019: Hackathon Fintech Workshop. In collaboration
    with Banca Mifel. Mostly undergraduate students from
    business, engineering, and tech careers. Learned about
    Unity3D, played around with NodeJS and some database engines.
    72 hours.
    In Teams.

    
    
--- Education: ---

    
2019 - 2022: PrepaTec Multicultural (PTM) 
    @ Tec de Monterrey (ITESM)
    (3 years) (Classes in English 
    and learned French)
    16 weeks per semester.  Had some classes in 5th and 6th semester
    to get a feeling of my undergrad degree.

<h1>On feelings</h1>

<a name="today"></a>
<h2>today</h2>

<p>Today. I woke up sunday twenty-seventh, twenty twenty-two at about twelve hours and thirteen minutes.</p>

<p>My parents attempted to wake me up earlier but were partially unsuccessful. I dont&rsquo;t remember much about what I was thinking about whilst still in bed. Point is, I woke up. I went to the bathroom. Maybe I peed. I put water on my face and rubbed it in with my fingers, feeling the oil kinda come off and stick to my finger tips. I then washed my hands with my blue soap.</p>

<p>After that I checked my phone. Nothing important. Just messages that are kind of irrelevant to me on a Sunday noon. I then proceedes to go downstairs - to the kitchen. I then though about what to eat. The bread was out, in its plastic bag, beside the fruits. The toaster was not there. I walked into the pantry, not much to eat or at least that I&rsquo;d be interested in eating.</p>

<p>Then I though, why not make some <em>tostadas españolas</em> ? And place a couple of sunny-side-up eggs on top.</p>

<p>tostadas españolas is a Spanish dish that consists mainly of raw garlic, tomatoes, and toasted bread. Like the bread you use for a PJ sandwich. You grind the tomato so you get this partially liquid, partially solid cream. You put in a bowl. I don&rsquo;t filter out the seeds. I get some garlic teeth (not sure how you say it), you peel off the skin, cut each of them in half. Then toast the bread to your liking.
After the bread is toasted, put on some plated, take the cut side of the garlic and spread it around whilst holding it with your fingers.
Spread! The heat of the toast makes some of the garlic come off.
Spread it all around like
some marmalade / jelly.</p>

<p>Then put the tomato grinded cream on the toasts. That is a <em>tostada española</em>. As you may recall, I mentioned some eggs. Sunny-side-up. That&rsquo;s how I like them.
make them however you like them.
Just place the eggs on top of the toasts and voilà!</p>

<p>You got yourself some tostadas españolas with a couple of eggs.
Keep in mind to get the timing right.
I did not tell you when to start
cooking the eggs.
But the way I did it was I started
to cook them. then after about 20 seconds I started the toaster.
By this point in time, I have already grinded the tomato and cut the garlics. I&rsquo;ve prepared the plates. The toasts are now done after 2-3 minutes. I let them rest in the toaster, with some heat still coming off it. Eggs almost done, I&rsquo;m turning the heat completely off. Now I go to the toasts, put them on a plate and start spreading the garlic around. Then the tomato thing.</p>

<p>Now I get the eggs ans gently place them over the toasts.</p>

<p>It is done! Parfait! Feast and eat!</p>

<a name="then"></a>
<h2>then</h2>

<p>after all that breakfast thing I washed all my plates and the cheese grater (which I uses to grind the tomatoes) along with my fork and
knifes. Then I enjoyed some of
the sun in my backyard, with some grass here and there.</p>

<p>After that, (I think) I messaged someone. They were busy. I was kinda stressed.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually talked to that person in a day or two. Then I decides to go watch a TV Show. But I remembered to
take my stupid meds. I drank some water.</p>

<p> Then headed upstairs to the TV.
 Turned it on. Opened the app, prepared to click on the profile
 my parents arrived.</p>

<p> I had promised my father that I&rsquo;d do some exercise. I haven&rsquo;t done any.
 Yet. So I left the TV, took my phone and
 headphones. Put on some shorts,
 a t-shirt (I was in pijamas) and headed out to walk in my neighbourhood.</p>

<p> My Mom recommended I take the dog.</p>

<p> So I did. I was lazy to take a bag for its poop. But I mentally
 swore to myself that I&rsquo;d go back for one when I was finished and pick it up.</p>

<p> So I looked for some sandals. It was sunny. I wanted sandals. I was wearing crocs. Good enough. I opened the door, called my dog,
 then headed outside and partially closed it.</p>

<p>Me, as I&rsquo;m writing this:</p>

<blockquote><p>i should probably take a shower, I&rsquo;m kinda late for a family reunion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ok, so I started walking and was kinda sad
about not being able to talk to that person before.</p>

<p>I started playing in order the Random Access Memories album from Daft Punk. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve paid enough attention to all the songs. People say it&rsquo;s very good.</p>

<p>So I listened to them. I skipped one song
because I was kinda frustrated about
the lyrics since it reminded me of
some feelings.</p>

<p>Then I began to think about isolation. I hadn&rsquo;t been this alone
in a while. Just with my thoughts, music,
and shit.</p>

<p>So I decided to make a ritual. An isolation ritual, just as I was walking.</p>

<p>That person is busy, so let&rsquo;s just get
our minds off that and try to be happy. I won&rsquo;t be taking much care of my dog. I&rsquo;ll let it be free. I&rsquo;ll go for her poop later. It&rsquo;s a gated community so she&rsquo;ll be just fine.</p>

<p>Then I though about some weird religion
which said to walk barefoot.
Though about it.</p>

<p>Then thought about some cultures
that put their bare feet no socks no
shoes on burning charcoal.</p>

<p>It was hot outside. I was walking on pavement. Then I got to grass. I walked barefoot on grass.</p>

<p>It felt nice. All this whilst playing the RAM album from daft punk.
There was a party yesterday. Seemed fun.
I was scared yesterday to go say hi.
Plus, I hadn&rsquo;t been invited. I didn&rsquo;t
go to the party yesterday, yet it was so close! Like one minute away! -walking!!!</p>

<p>So I went to the back of the shared grounds with grass and plants. I found poop. A big one. Not from my dog definitely. It was dry. At least five day&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d say. But I mentally
promised to pick this up.</p>

<p>I went to my house. Not for poop bag. But to take my crocs off and walk bare
foot - no socks no shoes no nothing.</p>

<p>Just me and my feet with human skin.</p>

<p>The pavement is hot. It&rsquo;s nice to
feel my toes with the pavement.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice walking. It&rsquo;s getting real hot. I&rsquo;m probably getting blisters
(ampollas for spanish, I hope).</p>

<p>who cares ? this is my ritual. What doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger.</p>

<p>this is how my dog walks anyways.
poor thing. But eventually I reached grass, decided not to step on any until the end of the road.</p>

<p>motivates myself to keep on walking (this feels similar to the Scatman&rsquo;s World song!?).</p>

<p>I then proceeded to tho around three to four laps. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>It helped me calm down.</p>

<p>I wrote this partially in the bathroom. I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m writing this. Goodbye, I&rsquo;ll go get a shower.</p>

<p>A DNS stands for Domain Name System.
It is simply a protocol for getting the IP address of any given domain name.</p>

<p>Usually, your Internet Service Provider (aka ISP) will provide you with one which may be a little slow,
or even may block certain websites.</p>

<p>Below is a guide on how to set your DNS to Cloudflare. Any of these
configurations can be (in theory) applied to all your network, but if you want there&rsquo;s nothing stopping you from doing this for a single device (just search &ldquo;how to set up DNS [device name])</p>

<p>DNS Cloudflare</p>

<p><a href="https://1.1.1.1">https://1.1.1.1</a></p>

<ol>
<li>For IPv4, replace the existing addresses with:   - 1.1.1.1   - 1.0.0.1 </li>
<li>For IPv6, replace the existing addresses with:
 2606:4700:4700::1111  2606:4700:4700::1001</li>
</ol>

<p>Hello there! Well, I was technically always here
but guess what? My computer stopped working.</p>

<p>I think I messed up some docker (compose?) configuration
and it basically adds an IP address to a network
interface which should be the one for my local area
network and my computer was probably confused where to route
incoming packets but I kinda just did a quick fix.</p>

<p>not sure if it&rsquo;ll survive after a reboot, since
the problem has persisted (as of now) across
reboots. But yeah we&rsquo;re back.</p>

<p>Maybe use webalizer ?
But apparently it&rsquo;s quite an old technology so it&rsquo;s not easy to use.

<a name="solution-21-"></a>
<h1>solution!</h1>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know how I did find it but it&rsquo;s <a href="https://goaccess.io/">goaccess</a> and it
generates a nice html with graphs and numbers and works good enough.</p>

<p>You can access the current stats @ https://trevcan.duckdns.org/stats
and a handful of other sym-linked dirs. Can you find them all?</p>

<p>It can give you the total number of requests among many other things
including user agents and stuff. just random numbers but real actually.</p>

<p>from people and software interacting with a 2014 hp computer. wow.</p>

<p><strong>this is probably a rant, discretion is advised but not obligatory.</strong></p>

<p>Hello. It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote something public.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in school - physically - and haven&rsquo;t got much time to do stuff.
Actually, that&rsquo;s a lie. I&rsquo;ve been in school but have gotten tons of
free time. But let&rsquo;s not shame ourselves, right ? I was supposed to
start blogging just when I turned on my computer today.</p>

<p>But I just spent an hour with bloat on my computer. Opening chrome,
converting an email to an image but first trying to save it as HTML but turns
out the HTML is js-filled with shit that doesn&rsquo;t even contain the email,
then uploading it to my server (<a href="https://trevcan.duckdns.org/files/%3DnTO%2B%27dKwl.png">look, it&rsquo;s live!</a>.</p>

<p>and then thinking that I should set up a website that uses mediagoblin because why tf not?
Well, because peertube is too fucking hard to set up. But maybe mediagoblin is too.</p>

<p>They got all these ton-shit dependencies. I mean, why the fuck do you need a MySQL-professional
grade database running on my system for it to work. I&rsquo;ve tried the docker  instances for both
mediagoblin and peertube but it&rsquo;s just a lot of software stacks!  I mean I&rsquo;d love to have something
like <a href="http://art.dressupgeekout.com/">this</a> showing my videos/ drawings, etc&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t even
know who I am.</p>

<p>Anyways, the point of this blog post was to write that I was going to  try to do something to make
my life better. The truth is, through my high-school journey I&rsquo;ve been with a scholarship. Nothing
to be ashamed of. But I fucked up. I&rsquo;m a senior now and didn&rsquo;t do anything good enough in terms of
grades for school. I need to have an average of at least 85 to keep my scholarship through high
school.</p>

<p>But to apply to another scholarship when entering college - yes, I&rsquo;m staying there and i think it&rsquo;s
good enough - I <strong>must have an average of <em>90</em></strong> as a minimum! Lame!!!</p>

<p>In other words, my dad&rsquo;s shitting himself in debt because high school is already expensive as it is
and in six months I&rsquo;ll be in college and he won&rsquo;t have that much money to pay.</p>

<p>So I gotta think of ways to make actual money. I&rsquo;ve never had a job before. I used to clean my dad&rsquo;s
shoes after work and he&rsquo;d give me a 20, a 50, sometimes an 80 (this is in Mexican pesos, a.k.a. a
one-buck, a two and fifty, and 4 bucks, respectively).</p>

<p>A few months ago in December 2021 I tried to get a job at a computer/printer/phone repair shop but
didn&rsquo;t get a reply. I was too lazy to reply again and say something like, so you want me or not?</p>

<p>But now I&rsquo;m like not that long from maybe getting my father into much more debt so I gGOTTA make money!!</p>

<p>Physical money, yes, not just philosophy or learning stuff or linux or programming or going out or helping
people but getting someone else to give me money for something that I do.</p>

<p>So I though of places where I&rsquo;d like to work at. I don&rsquo;t want to work at places where
their job is to steal other people&rsquo;s data. No NONO NONO . morally incorrect, very. for now I don&rsquo;t
want to work at a crazy FAANGM company!.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. The reality is the only place I though of to <strong>actually work at</strong> is
comma.ai . Yes, that small startup that is changing the world and I think has more than a million miles
of possible training data to make autonomous cars.</p>

<p>So I got to their careers page and eventually found out that they require some kidn of programming challenge
to enter their company. I had read about this on an HN post I submitted, it was one of George&rsquo;s blogposts.</p>

<p>ah, shit I got caught off again procrastinating when trying to find my hn submission. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28561025">here it is</a>.</p>

<p>anyways, I should do this programming challenge and probably should ask for a maybe remote internship ?</p>

<p>But one step at a time I guess&hellip;</p>

<p>I should probably eat.</p>

<p>Hello, I am bored. Also, I&rsquo;ve thought of kinda making my own daily blog entries
so here is one!</p>

<p>Today, well, more like yesterday since it&rsquo;s already midnight. I&rsquo;m actually
waiting for my other laptop to finish copying a disk partition to another
disk. I&rsquo;m using the one and only, legendary&hellip; dISk d3stroy3r !!! Yes,
that&rsquo;s right, I saw that in a Luke Smith Video! the thing is, I was
setting up the archivebox software which is basically a self-hosted
archive / wayback machine, pretty self-explanatory. I set it up with docker
and after a while of restarting it for some weird reason the home directory
of a new user I&rsquo;ve created was being chmoded by docker or the software
and idk really know what happened. Eventually, I figured out that for some
stupid reason I had no disk space left on my home partition. But it only
marked like 30 gigs used, meaning that for some weird reason I didn&rsquo;t
extend the partition ? So i got out my trusty red usb with ventoy on it
(lets you boot multiple OSes easily) and hopped on to gparted. It&rsquo;s
literally just raw debian ( i think?, i&rsquo;ve never tried it :v )
with gparted installed. it has an old school GUI like windows xp, has
work spaces, you can move windows around. a pretty solid desktop
environment. So, anyways, back to the story. I opened gparted and there
it was, like 100GB of free, unpartitioned, unallocated space!
so yeah, i just extended the home partition and no errors baby!</p>

<p>By this point. I shutdown the laptop, disconnect the trusty usb with oses
and boot the computer, everything seems normal, although the error still
appears telling me that there&rsquo;s no disk space! Oh no, maybe the root
partition?! So I just ran <code>df -h</code> to show available disk space on mounted
file systems, and low and behold!, indeed the root partition is full!
What!?, I only allocated 20GB to the root partition!?, who was the stupid
guy that did that ? (me of course) and then proceeded to create the swap
and boot partitions right next to it so that no free space is available.
Yayyy!!? my self! So yeah, moving partitions around is more prone to errors.
Plus, if you move any of the boot and/or root partition your system might not
boot, not pretty. So, just to be safe I got a spare HDD and clone the root
and home partition to it, because why not? After that I&rsquo;ll probably just wipe
the boot partitions from an archlinux iso in the trusty usb and move the
partitions around hoping that I don&rsquo;t have any errors so that I can extend
the free space in the root partition! Might as well use the external HDD as
the whole home partition! Why not? hmm, idk I&rsquo;ll think about it.</p>

<p>Some other things I did during the day (december 07 2021) were walk with my
dog, her name is Candy. Just walked around the neighbourhood, went to some
benches/tables with grass and a lot of sun! and setup a tiny parasol (omg
is this actually a word in english! I couldn&rsquo;t believe that when duckduckgo
showed the translation of sombrilla from spanish into parasol in english ?!
wft, why don&rsquo;t we Mexicans use this parasol word? maybe some old people do).
Also, I was planning on reading some French(-speaking?) poetry and translating
words i didn&rsquo;t know with a small spanish-to-french and viceversa dictionary.
In the end I only read like half of one page and got bored and walked with my
dog again who was escaping.</p>

<p>Honestly, I though the disk destroyer MI (mission impossible): operation would
be done by now. But it&rsquo;s not!? 60GB copied baby! no idea if it will copy the
whole partition with the unused space? ah, maybe, maybe not&hellip;</p>

<p>later in the day I started to use my laptop to research how to take
screenshots of webpages and just sat there, contemplated my life appreciating
the fact that puppeeteer ( i still don&rsquo;t know if i got taht spelling right!)
exists. Yay, so I could take screenshots using the chromium browser in
headless mode! Nice. Now I just want a way to make my own <a href="http://archive.is">http://archive.is</a>
or wayback machine! But without the shady tracking. I don&rsquo;t remember where
I heard but I think it has some serious web tracking and a ton-shit of
cookies. I only like real cookies. smh. and i bake them with my sister and we
make the dough from scratch and they&rsquo;re delicious. and I like those cookies,
I do not like these virtual, weird-ass cookies. I like tasting them irl.</p>

<p>wow, got a 781 word count! This guy knows how to speak/write/whatevss.
anyways, back to the story. I was trying to figure out how to <em>&lsquo;save&rsquo;</em> the
webpage. You know, how when you&rsquo;re in chrome/firefox and press ctrl+s and
it saves an html and the images i think as well. yeah, that. well, it turns
out there&rsquo;s no easy way per se of doing that. after kinda pulling my hair out
of my scalp I encountered the archivebox while searching through the aur for
<em>archive</em> to see if there was any kind of self-hosted software that was
like a little wayback machine! So it turns out it exists and I guess it kinda
works! the web UI is okay, maybe a little bloated, it has like fuck'in 11
cookies, and most definitely not the kind you can eat! So yeah, now I can
archive urls and store them on my computer and let others archive urls and
save it to my computer, hope I don&rsquo;t get sued for archiving something that
other people aren&rsquo;t happy about. aahhhh, this disk destroyer thing isn&rsquo;t over
yet. My plan was to just reinstall grub and the boot partition and that&rsquo;s it
man! just re-make the <code>/etc/fstab</code> so that the new uuids are recorded and
that&rsquo;s it! But no!, it was my great idea to re-extend the partition so now
it&rsquo;s copying everything! f**c it, i&rsquo;m cancelling the operation and shrinking
the partition as small as I can! holy shit! I only use like 2.16 GB in my home
partition! no wonder docker was complaining! I shrunk the partition to 5 GB
just to be safe and we should be re-installing and moving partitions round
nd round in no time ! Nice! gparted took literally less than 1 minute!</p>

<p>now just gotta create the boot partition from the usb thingy!</p>

<p>turned out great. kinda. was a few minutes wondering why there were no
kernels added to the grub config. Turns out kernels are installed in the
boot partition! I deleted that partition!
who would have known that? silly me, just had to pacman -S
linux and remove the old linux-zen which was having trouble with docker.</p>

<p>done i guess. you should be able to see this site now. back in business
baby.</p>

<p>this file contains a simple list of project ideas which may include
software projects with a small aim: providing something that isn&rsquo;t
currently available.</p>

<p>If the project is in progress, it&rsquo;ll be listed just after it.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas for projects&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>short: short url service with simple GET/POST http requests and
minimalist web UI.</li>
<li>clipme: copy of http://0x0.st . simply receive get/post requests and make
a file publicly available.</li>
<li>archivemoi: web archiver, just like the web archive wayback machine. maybe
using pupeteer (python library to use the chromium debugger thingy) to take
high quality screenshots, make PDFs and archive the hole html thing.</li>
<li><strong>implement all of the above using something such as fastcgi to serve  with simple web requests or something</strong></li>
<li>simple rss reader that parses rss/atom files and gives you a summary in html form or
even ANSI!</li>
<li>make simple, suckless, maybe in C, clipboard http POST pastebin. (examples: <a href="https://github.com/Willyfrog/pastas">https://github.com/Willyfrog/pastas</a>, <a href="http://0x0.st">http://0x0.st</a>, <a href="http://ix.io">http://ix.io</a>)</li>
<li>simple terminal ncurses app that can parse and generate vcard contact info!</li>
<li>archivemoi-gh:  GitHub archiver, generate token w/ private repo permissions</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello, this is just a list of useful links of geohot&rsquo;s hard-to-find (not
that hard actually) blogs. He actually still blogs but much much less
since he has a startup to take care of called <a href="http://comma.ai">comma.ai</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Geohot&rsquo;s current blog: <a href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/"><em>geohot.github.io/blog/</em></a></li>
<li>Jailbreak blog: from 2007 to 2009:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090716104350/http://iphonejtag.blogspot.com/"><em>iphonejtag.blogspot.com, archived.</em></a>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080208175647/http://lpahome.com/">lpahome.com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>i should probably go study french or something, shit. My exam is in less
than 12 hours. ignore this, wait, don&rsquo;t ignore me.</p>

<p>TODO; fix up css to
show small, less annoying tag links in the index file i guess ?</p>

<p>hey there! I don&rsquo;t know why this came to me but I guess I&rsquo;ve seen
several internet videos in which linuxy users are using a nice, fancy
prompt to search files. Turns out they&rsquo;re using
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/">fzf!</a>
, a nice tool to easily search for files in the command line. To some
degree I guess it is like a dmenu prompt but in a command line. So yeah,
by default it acts like a find any file recursively in the current directory,
yes, including hidden files; yet still acts like a standard unix command
that can take input from stdin (standard input) and only show those choices
and of course, prints to stdout the result.</p>

<p>So one can do something like</p>

<p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF | fzf
one
two
three
four
john cena
EOF

</code></pre>
and that will basically show you an interactive command line prompt which can
let you make a choice. This is kind of similar to pedantic software&rsquo;s choice
tool by
Sylvain Gauthier and Francois-Xavier Carton.
<a href="https://pedantic.software/syg/blog/minimalism_2_choice.html">Here&rsquo;s</a> a blog
post from Sylvain in which he explains what his tool does and its uses. I
guess it kinda differs to some degree but yeah.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the fuzzy finder. So after seeing how not so useful this was,
at least to me, I decided to make a quick internet search to see if I could
use this in vim. And I could! As I&rsquo;ve already said at the start of this post,
I&rsquo;ve seen several internet humans use vim as a file-finder. So I cloned a
sample vim plugin which connects the fzf vim plugin which only gives core
functions but doesn&rsquo;t actually implement anything. So installing all these
stuff gives me a pretty prompt like this:
<img src="https://trevcan.duckdns.org/files/fzf-in-vim.png" alt="fzf in vim" /></p>

<p>and yeah that&rsquo;s cool, isn&rsquo;t it?
If you&rsquo;re interested in how to set it up I&rsquo;ll put the steps below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>install fzf, can be found in the official Arch Linux repos and pretty much
any other distro</p></li>
<li><p>install fzf core functions vim plugin; simply clone the official fzf repo
to <code>~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/fzfcore</code> to start the plugin on vim startup.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><pre><code>git clone "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git" ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/fzfcore
</code></pre>
note: this will only work if you have the vim pack functionality. It probably
is if you keep vim up to date. I think this was released in vim 8.0</p>

<ol>
<li>install <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf.vim</a> as another vim
plugin. Same as step 2.</li>
</ol>


<p><pre><code>git clone "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim" ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/fzf.vim
</code></pre>
And that should do the trick. Now just readthedocs @
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim#commands">the fzf.vim docs readme</a>
and tldr;: use <code>:Files</code> to search within your home dir, hit enter and the file
will be opened in vim. Also, it will show you a small preview (with syntax
highlighting, if <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> is installed.)</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s it for this blog post. should probably sleep.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite simple. No, I didn&rsquo;t create any of
these config files but I guess sharing is caring, right?</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KdnGPQaICjk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KdnGPQaICjk</a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how i stumbled upon this video. Here are some ideas I wrote down.</p>

<ul>
<li>junk
not knowing who to blame.</li>
</ul>


<p>hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand technology&rdquo; &ndash;>
    &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get the crappy menus&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>yes, OF COURSE you can argue with tech !</p>

<p>MS windows</p>

<p>the wrapper is what we see!</p>

<p>determinism. nature is given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;why can&rsquo;t I x,y,z,&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash;>
    &ldquo;because computers don&rsquo;t allow it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>yes, so true! I think we should all break
from our shells</p>

<ul>
<li>there are no objective criteria.</li>
<li>like dog breeds, there are thousands of computer ideas and they can be
endlessly combined</li>
<li>many of them [ideas] have fanatical
following</li>
<li><em>then gives examples of several softwares and how they kind of came to be</em>

<ul>
<li>utf-8, ascii, another weird character set that was like 7 bits for chars
and 4 bits for numbers ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>whoami ? well, honestly, no one to have the authority to say anything relevant
regarding this issue. I am merely a teenager so please you have all the right
to ignore this stuff; also, i don&rsquo;t know why i just wrote this paragraph.</p>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s get to it. Thanks to my respect to myself of privacy and the right
to actually have an annoying private life and talk to people, browse the
internets without actually being spied on and be farmed on as a farm animal
for personal data I have several ads coming up very often. Repeating
themselves. A lot. Literally, <strong>a lot lot lotlotststs</strong>.</p>

<p>The ad that&rsquo;s annoying me the most is Le <em>Grammarly</em>. You&rsquo;ve probably heard of
it if you&rsquo;re a student, unfortunately. I don&rsquo;t have any actual grudge against
spell checkers or whatever but I think taking the things to a much farther
level is bad. You shouldn&rsquo;t be inferring or passive-aggressively suggesting
grammar styles to students. They should write like they want, of course
when turning in an assignment check your spelling and coherence of ideas or
whatever; but that&rsquo;s it! Literally it! I shouldn&rsquo;t have a little shit software
tell me that I&rsquo;ve plagiarized something! If I have, I will definitely know
myself. Okay, maybe if you forget but that&rsquo;s it. Also, I think that these
kinds of companies that most likely use a shit-load of data-sets to infer
what <em>should be written</em> are wrong. Just like several machine learning algos
have proven to have very biased datasets, this could prove a new era of having
biased opinions, essays, and ideas in general. We do not have to put
everything thru a pseudo-fancy software that tells you which ideas are right
and wrong and/or (in) coherently written. That&rsquo;s literally the job of your
teacher. If you&rsquo;re leaving it up to <em>gruh-meourlee</em> to tell you what to write
you shouldn&rsquo;t consider writing at all. It&rsquo;s your writing! It&rsquo;s yur ideas!
Decide for yourself. <em><strong>fuck up for yourself</strong></em> and <em>don&rsquo;t</em>.</p>

<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do one on the cheesy-like software if you
know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;ll maybe rant about plagiarism and capitalised
knowledge when studying. Not sure if I said that write. English is (not?) my
first language. I was born in the U.S. but only lived there for 4 years ffs,
so I guess I&rsquo;ve absorbed a style of my own and I should note, most of the
internet/media content I view / watch / listen to is in English, so yeah,
there&rsquo;s that. Whatever.</p>

<p>edit: see end of post.</p>

<p>Hey there fellow read-capable human! I am here to tell you a story about
git hooks. Well, first let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about how remote repos work.</p>

<p>From the little knowledge I think I have, a git server can be run through ssh,
you must create a git user which is in fact the user you login as when pushing
your git object references. Most of the time, this will happen in a bare git
repo. That is, a repo which only contains the contents of what you would
normally expect the
<pre><code>.git
</code></pre>
contents to be. So in fact there&rsquo;s no working directory but only history
changes with reference objects and stuff. But in fact this is probably wrong,
as most people most likely use services such as github.com, gitlab.com,
etcetera. And those websites can show you the files and in fact show you
the &lsquo;working directory&rsquo; of you repo, and the files themselves. So most git
servers you interact with are probably not bare since the aforementioned
services show you the files. So I chose to setup a git server on my home server
, pretty straight forward. Setup some ssh keys to not be spammed or something.
Then I had the amazing idea to migrate my blog over to my home server so I
did it and migrated slowly to <a href="https://pedantic.software/git/blogit">blogit</a>.
Actually, I started my own fork:
<a href="http://github.com/trevcan/blogit">github/trevcan/blogit</a>. So anyways, back to
the actual story.</p>

<p>My blog was doing okay until I started to try building server side. The problem
was that the articles were being messed up in terms of last edited and last
updated dates and I really didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Until I stumbled upon the
fact that having different locales can mess up programs such as the gnu&rsquo;s
coreutils program sort. So yeah, all I had to do was export LC_ALL=C to
make it fix itself.</p>

<p>Then I wantd to find out how to automate this process. Since I could already
push to my own git server, I was able to use git hooks. But after that I kind
of got lost since the commands did execute but the index.html file was never
properly generated. This is due to the fact that git proudly changes some
environment variables because it wants to and barely documented them [0].
So I stumbled upon [1] and then found out all I had to do was add the unset
function to that env variable since blogit uses git magic to figure out the
last updated and last edited things and it though my repo was somehwere else
when it wasn&rsquo;t so yeah. I actually haven&rsquo;t tested it and after I finish
writing this blog post it will be the actual guinea pig to see if it actually
works. You know, so I don&rsquo;t get stuck in the &lsquo;automating somehting for hours
and not do any actual work&rsquo; thing. So I&rsquo;m writing this post as kind of
an obligatory thing since I barely have anything on the blog. I mean, I have
like 20 articles but most of them barely say anything.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m going to track this on git and commit and push I guess.</p>

<a name="references"></a>
<h3>references</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://longair.net/blog/2011/04/09/missing-git-hooks-documentation/">0: Missing git hooks docs</a>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9228921/git-post-update-script-does-not-work">1: git post update script does not work <em>stackoverflow.com</em></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>guess what :( ?? it didn&rsquo;t work. apparently it&rsquo;s not pulling the latest changes
I push for some weird reason and when I pull them as the git user in a shell
it works perfectly fine and detects new changes. i removed some arguments
i had in the git pull command so let&rsquo;s see if that works.</p>

<p>you should watch it.</p>

<p>spoilers ahead if that ain&rsquo;t obvious enough.</p>

<p>Hey there, I just watched the movie <a href="https://www.filmaffinity.com/mx/film644257.html">Un beso en el asfalto (2017) <em>filmaffinity.com</em></a>
and it was pretty cool. Weirdly enough, I think that it was hilarious that it
showed surprisingly different perspectives from all angles, even outside the
context of the movie. Hell, it even showed a threatre reading the script,
presenting it with props in front of an audience, and when they were recording
it. It was kinda like Shutter island in the sense that the end is whatever your
brain&rsquo;s interpretation is. So yeah, maybe I&rsquo;ll update this post idk.</p>

<p>log:
~ 6:24 P.M
git status has one untracked file.
only one. no changes on tracked files.
will try to build /deploy the site
without adding this new blog post.</p>

<a name="test-1"></a>
<h1>test 1</h1>

<p>$ make main
a lot of text and shit
git status now shows indeed more
untracked files; the new
blog post, the tags folder, the blog
folder and the www folder</p>

<hr />

<p>I am now opening the www/index.html file
relative to the repo root.
Yayyy!!! it works like a charm. CSS works,
everything works.
The latest article I published is
&ldquo;Derivatives Stuff Calculus&rdquo; and is indeed
correct. At the time of writing this, it is
the only article that has been created,commited,
and pushed to the github and home server repo.
So yeah, it works.</p>

<p>small note:
<em>something i noticed is that sometimes the tags</em>
<em>were kind of misplaced, sometimes the tag TBA</em>
* appears almost at the start, near &lsquo;API&rsquo; and &lsquo;C&rsquo;<em>
</em>but now it seems to be in the 2nd line.*
<strong>This  is definitely not the case when viewing </strong>
<strong>the version with the bad commit dates</strong>
<strong> <a href="https://archive.md/9Fn0i/image">wrong sample</a></strong></p>

<a name="test-2"></a>
<h1>test 2</h1>

<p>ok, so as we can see in test #1, it worked like a
charm when not adding any new files, having a clean
build dir and one new blog post (untracked file).</p>

<p>Now, I wonder something, if I did not commit
any changes, the last commit I made is the same as the
last one in the github repo, which means that they built
off of the same commited files. How can having
untracked files and a clean build dir affect this ??
who knows&hellip;</p>

<p>Now what i will do is execute a clean</p>

<p>$ make clean</p>

<p>now i will attempt building the site again and comparing
results. Keep in mind that I still have the untracked file.</p>

<p>$ make main</p>

<p>ok, great. Same thing, results are literally the same.
Honestly I expected this since the &lsquo;main&rsquo; target in the
makefile has as a first dependency the clean thingy.</p>

<p><em>note: maybe it has to do something with the .PHONY thingy</em>
* in makefiles. that you&rsquo;re supposed to use it your targets*
* aren&rsquo;t actually files ??? *</p>

<p>okay. now to experiment # 3</p>

<a name="test-3"></a>
<h1>test 3</h1>

<p>okay, so my plan for test 3 is the following. make clean,
then start tracking the new blog post i just made,
    commit only that change, make clean again, and try to build.
    Between each of these operations, I will build and &lsquo;deploy&rsquo;
    the site locally to see if it changes in any particular stage.</p>

<p><pre><code>$ make clean
$ make main
</code></pre>
I did it and then another main just to be safe and sure enough,
it is working persistently as expected.</p>

<p><pre><code>$ git add articles/why-blogit.md
$ make main
</code></pre>
Ok, still the same, since I haven&rsquo;t made a commit with the new
article, the article should not appear on the index, which is good
and works as expected. The other articles still appear in the right
order. now let&rsquo;s commit changes!</p>

<p><pre><code>$ git commit -m 'add blogit issue article'
$ make main
</code></pre>
and sure enough, works like a charm! the new blog post appears
at the top and the next one is indeed the last one I committed, which
makes lots of sense. So, nothing wrong as of now&hellip;. now let&rsquo;s do exp 4</p>

<a name="test-4"></a>
<h1>test 4</h1>

<p>so now i want to try to make a clean, and then a main.
<pre><code>$ make clean
$ make main
</code></pre>
ok, great. It still works like a charm! literally got the same exact
content. now on to test 5</p>

<a name="test-5"></a>
<h1>test 5</h1>

<p>I honestly do not know what to try now. I think in this one I&rsquo;ll checkout
to the last commit the github repo has (25f4b89, 5 h ago) and try building it.</p>

<p>first of all, I&rsquo;ll try to clean up.
<pre><code>$ make clean
$ git checkout 25f4b89 
$ make main
</code></pre>
ok, so (un)fortunately I still have not found the bug! It still builds as if it
were very normal! In fact, it indeed builds correctly, but for some reason it did not when I
pushed it to github pages ??</p>

<p>now i really don&rsquo;t know wut to do.
now i will checkout to master</p>

<p><pre><code>$ git checkout master
</code></pre>
ok</p>

<a name="test-6"></a>
<h1>test 6</h1>

<p>now i will attempt to push my latest commit to the github repo and to my home server, I will
try to see if behaviours change.
<pre><code>$ make clean
$ git push
</code></pre>
ok, the github push built in like 25 seconds. so yeah, that&rsquo;s great i guess.
Now the moment of truth&hellip;.  ah shitt&hellip;. for some weird reason it keeps
not using the correct commit date.
Weirdly enough, all the articles show the same DATE but not the same time.
the 404.md  simply says that it was allegedly last edited today, 11/10/21
@ 13:19:18. now my new blog post which appears at the bottom literally the
third one from bottom to top!, it says that iwas last edited also
today 11/10/21 @ 18:41:11 which is correct! now I do not know what the issue
is..!!</p>

<p>okay, now let&rsquo;s try pushing to the home server and seeing if we have the same results.
<pre><code>$ make clean
$ git push home-site
</code></pre>
okay, I&rsquo;ve pushed the master branch to the master branch at the home server, let&rsquo;s try this.
okay so I&rsquo;ve built it from my home server. But now it shows somehwat wrong results but still
different than github. I reckon this has something to do with dates. This is getting interesting
or idk. Now the first article at the top is &lsquo;How do i fix this blogit&rsquo; which is, indeed,
the last article I committed. But the next one is 404, which is definitely not what I&rsquo;ve committed
recently. next is about:trevcan, haven&rsquo;t made any recent updates, and so on. the second most
recent article is right below the middle, the sixth one from bottom to top.</p>

<p>hey there, I hope you are having a nice day.
Today was a much more intersting day than the rest of the week,
I got to actually deploy my <a href="http://trevcan.duckdns.org/blog">blog mirror</a>
and it literally looks exactly like on github, exect that mime types
are not auto-completed like in github, e.g. i can type something like
<pre><code>http://trevcan.github.io/index
</code></pre>
and it will be the same as
<pre><code>http://trevcan.github.io/index.html
</code></pre>
and so on. I guess there&rsquo;s some plugin in <em>nginx</em> that I can use or something.
Should also add https or something, although since I&rsquo;m not hosting any
arbitrary code, it is simply rendering html and css (no js folks!) it shouldn&rsquo;t
be a problem, right?</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, onto another random thing. There&rsquo;s a problem with
<a href="http://github.com/trevcan/blogit"><em>blogit</em></a>
(<a href="http://trevcan.duckdns.org/git/blogit/log.html">mirror</a>
. See, the issue is that sometimes I deploy it and it works perfectly. The most
recent article pops up at the top of the index html file but sometimes, more like
almost every time it stops working out of nowhere! Github and my computer and
my home server all react the same way as long as they were on the same commit/
working directory etc&hellip;. When this happens, <strong>every article gets the same edit
date</strong> which is nuts! And then for some weird reason the 404 article pops up
right at the top! <a href="https://archive.md/9Fn0i/image">look!</a></p>

<p>So yeah I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;ll tackle this problem.  I was doing some light
testing and I think when one of the build directories existen the commit date/
last edited date worked correctly and most recent articles were always at
the top. I guess I&rsquo;ll look into that.</p>

<p>Also, as you might have noticed, I now have a static html thingy showing
some git repos. the server works and everything and I&rsquo;m using
<a href="http://duckdns.org"><em>duckdns.org</em></a> to serve my dynamic ip address
and use their free dns subdomain services and it works well enough and you can
have up to 5 subdomains.</p>

<p>so yeah, that&rsquo;s it. I'llprobably solve this problem right now maybe??</p>

<p>Another year, another FRC Season. I&rsquo;m currently in the Tecbot 3158 First
Robotics Competition, a great way in which students of all STEM fields can
show their abilities through teamwork.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m in the engineering part. My job, for now, is to gather scouting
data for our team to analyze with maybe some ML models or just to make simple
statistics.</p>

<a name="setup"></a>
<h2>setup</h2>

<p>Thankfully, TBA (<em>the blue alliance</em>) has a public read-access (and write, i
believe) API, it&rsquo;s JSON and it lets you access almost everything. You just
have to sign in with google and get an API key. Now use any HTTP-GET
friendly request to retrieve data. Just remember to assign the HTTP header
<code>X-TBA-Auth-Key</code> to the API key you receive.</p>

<p>Hello there, I&rsquo;ve just finished mygration of my website
over to <a href="https://github.com/trevcan/blogit">my fork of blogit</a>
and so far so good. Just have to fix up the 404 and should
probably be good to go.</p>

<h1>Hello there,</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying out several bloggin systems but none of them seem to work
as I expect them. Well, to be frank, the only blogging systems I&rsquo;ve been
trying are only Jekyll/Github based. The only thing I want is a nice
<a href="https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog">hacker-like</a> aesthethic because
why not and minimalist software that doesn&rsquo;t have a ton shit of folders like
Jekyll, <strong>I just don&rsquo;t get why I can&rsquo;t add posts anywhere other than in <code>_posts/</code>!!</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, this is a check to see if this post actually gets built because only the
sample posts have appeared so far !!. <strong>Edit</strong>: You know what?, why not start
doing it right fucking know lol. I guess I&rsquo;ll create a test repo where I can idk
do shit and test <code>blogit</code>.</p>

<p>Hello there, I&rsquo;m a human!
I&rsquo;m into programming, computers, and of course,
the beloved <em>linux</em> (I use <a href="http://archlinux.org">arch</a> btw).
I like learning about new things, and enjoy riding
bikes, reading books such as 1984 (George Orwell), talking to people,
and breathing.</p>

<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;ve decided to start writing / blogging so yeah this is me
attempting to set up a minimalist blogging system with blogit I guess
and a tad of github actions automation with gh pages.</p>

<p><a href="contact.html">contact info here</a></p>

<h3>Software used:</h3>

<ul>
<li>webserver - <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>, pronounced <em>lightly</em>.</li>
<li><code>markdown</code> or <code>discount</code> > A Markdown implementation written in C.

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s in the arch repos as the <code>discount</code> package but installs a program called <code>markdown</code> among other things.</li>

<h3>coding bloat, maybe not?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a liar. I&rsquo;ll be sincere.
I have not checked any of these programming &lsquo;practice websites and don&rsquo;t really agree with the constant practice of problems after problems after problems.</p>

<p>I think i checked out l33tcode but that was like 2 years ago and I don&rsquo;t see it necessary. I should write a blog post about this.</p>

<p>First of all, your help, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>[h]
the problem
[/h]
I&rsquo;ve been using the [https://passwordstore.org] program for quite a while now, about 9 months I&rsquo;d say.
All was going well until about 4 weeks ago. I don&rsquo;t
know what happened, what caused it or why. Pass started acting up, it took from
20 to 30 seconds what used to take literally 1 second. The pinentry-gtk-2
program was taking a whole lot of time to start. So I dug deeper. Eventually I
found out that it definitely had something to do with GnuPG as decrypting
files directly through GnuPG also yielded the same results, after all, pass is
just a bash script that uses gpg encryption and decryption commands. So then I
went searching on the internets and it was pretty bad. I couldn&rsquo;t really find
any information regarding GnuPG besides [0]</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried almost* everything to get gpg up and running but it just,
won&rsquo;t work! I don&rsquo;t know if this was a system upgrade or
something but point is, it just slowed way down. When [b]requesting a password, [/b]
it&rsquo;d take anywhere from 20 to 40 seconds to just show the pinentry binary (the
one that asks you for the password), in particular, the <code>pinentry-gtk-2</code>, but
guess what? I tried using the ncurses version also and it didn&rsquo;t work! I tried
decrypting and encrypting files directly by using gpg, but yielded the same
results!, also tried with the <code>pinentry-tty</code> binary.</p>

<p>I tried the stackexchange solution but it didn&rsquo;t work. Later on,
I hopped onto libera IRC to join the <code>gnupg</code> channel, as
suggested by members in the <code>pass</code> channel, as this is clearly much more
specific to gpg. In the <code>gnupg</code> channel I had the fortune to be able to talk to
someone to walk me through a ton of things. Testing, after testing and testing.
We even tried creating less-resource intensive keys, creating temporary gnu
directories to store keys in, et cetera.</p>

<p>[b]
Also, I should point out that the behaviour is not intermittent, [em] it is
definitely constant. [/em]
I do have a password cache enabled, but every time time
has passed or I manually clear the password cache (with [code] echo RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent [/code] ) the same behaviour happens.

Well, add these lines in your gpg-agent.conf file and tail the log file on another window see live what is going on :

<p>After trying several things to fix encryption and decryption in GnuPG I have no
real hopes. I honestly don&rsquo;t know what to do but to keep asking. I&rsquo;ve searched on
stackoverflow for pinentry and gpg-agent acting up and taking too much time and
I only found one stack overflow question <a href="#references">[0]</a> which didn&rsquo;t get
that close to my issue.
It slows down when using the pinentry-curses, pinentry-gtk-2 binaries.</p>

<p>edit: I found out the problem! Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuPG/comments/q2apuh/comment/hpa3m6f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">u/xXbobby123Xx</a> for discovering the solution,
and this GNU forum: <a href="https://dev.gnupg.org/T3240">https://dev.gnupg.org/T3240</a> it appears to be a bug in gnome-keyring.</p>

<p><strong>Uninstalling the gnome-keyring is the solution for now.</strong></p>

<p>there appear to be 2 dev.gnupg.org forum posts:
- https://dev.gnupg.org/T3240
- https://dev.gnupg.org/T4592 (this url is kinda broken but didn&rsquo;t use to be)</p>

<p>First of all, your help, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><em>Maybe this will be Unix/Linux specific, i don&rsquo;t really know.</em></p>

<p>Hello. I&rsquo;ve tried almost* everything to get gpg up and running but it just,
won&rsquo;t work! So, storytime. Almost after I went full linux I stumbled upon
<a href="http://passwordstore.org">pass</a>, a great tool to manage passwords in a
convenient way. I&rsquo;ve been using it for around 8-9 months. And it&rsquo;s worked like
a charm, until about 3 weeks ago. I don&rsquo;t know if this was a system upgrade or
something but point is, it just slowed way down. When requesting a password,
it&rsquo;d take anywhere from 20 to 40 seconds to just show the pinentry binary (the
one that asks you for the password), in particular, the <code>pinentry-gtk-2</code>, but
guess what? I tried using the ncurses version also and it didn&rsquo;t work! I tried
decrypting and encrypting files directly by using gpg, but yielded the same
results!, cause after all, <code>pass</code> is just a bash script that uses gpg commands
for encryption and decryption. So, yeah. After that, I tried searching on the
internets, but didn&rsquo;t stumble upon anything at all except for
<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/628092/why-would-gpg-pinentry-be%0A-slow-when-opening-in-gui-but-instantaneous-when-openin">this</a> which didn&rsquo;t seem to
solve the problem, as my problem happened with all <code>pinentry*</code> binaries (yes,
even <code>pinentry-tty</code> !!). I tried the solution but it didn&rsquo;t work. Later on,
actually yesterday, I hopped onto libera IRC to join the <code>gnupg</code> channel, as
suggested by members in the <code>pass</code> channel, as this is clearly much more
specific to gpg. In the <code>gnupg</code> channel I had the fortune to be able to talk to
someone to walk me through a ton of things. Testing, after testing and testing.
We even tried creating less-resource intensive keys, creating temporary gnu
directories to store keys in, et cetera. I&rsquo;m documenting most (if not all, )
this info at <a href="https://trevcan.github.io/gpg.why">this website</a> .</p>

<p><strong>Also, I should point out that the behaviour is not intermittent, <em>it is
definitely constant</em>. I do have a password cache enabled, but every time time
has passed or I manually clear the password cache (with <code>echo RELOADAGENT |
gpg-connect-agent</code> and then <code>gpgconf --kill all</code>) the same behaviour happens.</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried this yet, but maybe later in the day I&rsquo;ll try booting off a
linux arch iso and trying to install gpg and checking if it&rsquo;s my laptop or
something&hellip;</p>

<p>*maybe i will reinstall arch linux</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To live, is to risk it all.<br>
Otherwise you&rsquo;re just an inert<br>
chunk of randomly assembled molecules<br>
drifting wherever the universe<br>
blows you.&rdquo;<br></p></blockquote>

<p>- Rick Sanchez (from the show <em>Rick and Morty</em>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Money will not make you happy,<br>
and happy will not make you money.</p></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free.
But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.</p></blockquote></li>
</ul>


<p>- Frank Herbert, Dune</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;So don&rsquo;t be afraid; your heart is in me, and it&rsquo;s racing so fast now.
&lsquo;Cause everything we ever were or ever will be is shapeless as a changing cloud.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<li>(<em>Endless Dream, by Conjure One</em>; song)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I prefer a dangerous freedom to
a peaceful slavery&hellip; &rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>- Thomas Jefferson</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;While you are failing to define success (and thereby rendering it
impossible) you are also refusing to define failure, to yourself, so that
if and when you fail you won&rsquo;t notice, and it won&rsquo;t hurt. But that won&rsquo;t
work! You cannot be fooled so easily - unless you have gone very far down
the road! You will instead carry with you a continual sense of
disappointment in your own Being and the self-contempt that comes along
with that and the increasing hatred for the world that all of that generates
(or degenerates).&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Jordan Peterson (12 Rules for Life).</li>
<li>no, I haven&rsquo;t read the book. I stumbled upon it when playing typeracer.com</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you think privacy is unimportant for you because you have nothing to
hide, you might as well say free speech is unimportant for you because you
have nothing useful to say.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<li><p>comments from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3RxGaw9buM">Positividad Tóxica, lo bueno y lo malo del coaching | THE WILD PROJECT</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Cristian Exposito Reviriego</li>
<li><blockquote><p>“En una sociedad donde puedes hacer de todo, tienes que lograr algo.”                        <br>
Es una construcción psicológica. Todo el mundo puede hacer lo que sea.<br>
Entonces todo el mundo tiene que ser algo.<br>
El nivel de exigencia no se había visto antes en la historia de la humanidad.<br>
“Somos 70% más productivos que hace 50 años. Somos unas máquinas de producir <br>
y sin embargo, sigue habiendo demasiada frustración. Sabiendo psicología:<br>
uno nunca logra satisfacer sus deseos por completos. El vacío de la falta<br>
nunca se llena realmente. El ser humano es una máquina desecante.<br>
Nos falta algo y por eso caminamos decía Lacan. <br>
Siempre buscamos más cosas, algo más.<br>
Es un deseo por ser completos.<br>
El problema es que ese deseo se instrumentalizo en <br>
nombre de la hiperproductividad.”<br>
“La gente que te exige positividad no es que te quiera ver bien, es que <br>
no puede tolerar tu queja, esa es la diferencia.”<br>
“Si no le damos lugar a las quejas, no desaparecen.”<br></p></blockquote></li>

<li>Guerra de los Mundos (Orson Wells, 1938)

<ul>
<li>interesante suceso del que me ha contado mi hermana.
Lo encontramos en una de las historias de La taverna del ciervo blanco (Arthur C. Clarke).
Mi hermana me cuenta que conmovió
a gran cantidad de personas debido
a que la manera en que fue contada la
historia era tan realista que la
gente pensaba que sí estaba pasando el suceso.
Que los alienígenas estaban atacando por doquier el mundo.
<em>Cabe recalcar que esta novela fue contada en forma de <strong>radio novela</strong></em></li>
